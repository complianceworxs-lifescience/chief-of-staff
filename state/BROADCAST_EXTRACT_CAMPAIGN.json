      "body": "Hi [Name],\n\nI'm seeing a massive shift in Q4.\n\nMy top clients are quietly abandoning \"Traditional CSV\" (manual screenshots, massive Word docs, retroactive traceability).\n\nThe math just doesn't work anymore:\n\n• You cannot validate AI/ML at human speed.\n• \"Reviewing documentation\" is eating 60% of the budget.\n• Auditors are starting to flag static snapshots as \"insufficient evidence.\"\n\nIf we are still validating like it's 2015, we are essentially documenting the past while competitors are validating the future.\n\nI compiled the \"Audit Readiness Checklist\" that I use to help teams transition off manual CSV. It highlights the 5 evidence gaps auditors are hunting for right now.\n\nClick here to download the PDF directly. (No opt-in needed since you're already on my list).\n\nQuestion for you: Are you still taking screenshots manually, or have you moved to automated evidence capture yet?\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",

They're not cutting corners—they're following GAMP 5 2nd Edition while you're stuck in the past.\n\nEvery month you wait, you're burning budget on activities that don't actually reduce risk.\n\nThe shift to Critical Thinking-based validation isn't coming.
