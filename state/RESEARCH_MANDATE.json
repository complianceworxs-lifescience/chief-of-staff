These manual methods (spreadsheets, paper, shared drives) are often perceived as 'free' but carry immense hidden costs and contribute directly to complexity. The primary trigger for software adoption is typically when these hidden costs become visible, often through audit failures, scalability issues, or increased regulatory pressure. Existing software competitors, while offering automation, often introduce their own forms of complexity (cost, implementation, inflexibility). Therefore, the messaging must focus on explicitly beating this systemic complexity, positioning the solution as a strategic asset that streamlines operations, reduces risk, and drives business value, rather than simply being a tool."
