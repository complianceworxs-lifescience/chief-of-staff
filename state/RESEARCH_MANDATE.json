      "reasoning": "The core narrative 'Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset.' is deeply embedded in these justifications. For Tier III enterprise buyers in Life Sciences, the premium pricing is validated by the necessity of these features to maintain regulatory adherence, protect sensitive data, and ensure operational continuity. These are not 'nice-to-haves' but 'must-haves' that directly mitigate substantial financial, legal, and reputational risks. The value proposition shifts from 'what the software does' to 'what risks the software eliminates and what opportunities it unlocks securely and compliantly'."
