      "reasoning": "The justification for premium pricing in Tier III Life Sciences software hinges on transforming compliance from a cost center into a strategic asset. Enterprise buyers are not merely purchasing software; they are investing in comprehensive risk mitigation, demonstrable operational efficiency, and an unwavering commitment to regulatory integrity that directly impacts patient safety and business viability. The mandatory features listed ensure not only stringent adherence to critical regulatory frameworks (like 21 CFR Part 11, GxP, GDPR, HIPAA) but also provide a robust foundation for data trust, security, and auditability that is non-negotiable for their core business operations. These capabilities enable faster audits, drastically reduce internal validation burdens, prevent costly data breaches or non-compliance fines, and ultimately accelerate time-to-market for critical life-saving products. The comprehensive suite of security, auditability, and service guarantees validates the higher price point by delivering measurable, critical value in a highly regulated and risk-averse environment where compliance is a strategic competitive advantage, not just an overhead."
