The proposed Tier II (Velocity) pricing of ~$500-2000/month (i.e., $6,000-$24,000 annually) represents a minimal investment against these potential losses. The platform justifies its cost almost immediately, often within 10 days, by delivering tangible productivity gains, reducing the likelihood and severity of adverse regulatory events, and turning compliance from a reactive overhead into a proactive, measurable business asset.
