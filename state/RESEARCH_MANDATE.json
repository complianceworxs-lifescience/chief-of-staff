      "reasoning": "The premium pricing for Tier III (Asset/Enterprise) in Life Sciences regulatory compliance is unequivocally justified by the non-negotiable requirements for governance, security, and auditability. These features are not merely 'add-ons' but fundamental necessities that mitigate catastrophic regulatory, financial, and reputational risks inherent in the life sciences sector. Enterprises view compliance-by-design as a strategic investment that enables faster time-to-market for regulated products, significantly reduces operational overhead associated with audits and validation, and stringently safeguards critical scientific, clinical, and patient data. The perceived high cost is an investment in measurable business assets: regulatory approval confidence, unimpeachable data integrity, and robust operational resilience. The buyer's willingness to pay more is intrinsically driven by the inherent and substantial cost of non-compliance, which vastly outweighs the premium for a truly compliant, secure, and auditable enterprise-grade solution. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
