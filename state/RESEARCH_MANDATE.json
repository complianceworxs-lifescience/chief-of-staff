Even a single major compliance event like a delayed product launch ($1.25M-$10M per event) or a Warning Letter ($1M-$5M+ remediation per event) can be catastrophic. By annualizing the risk exposure across various categories (manual efforts, regulatory actions, audit failures, emergency fixes), we see a conservative total annual risk between $580,000 and $3.55M. The software's ability to automate, centralize, and provide real-time compliance status directly mitigates these risks.

Even a single major compliance event like a delayed product launch ($1.25M-$10M per event) or a Warning Letter ($1M-$5M+ remediation per event) can be catastrophic. By annualizing the risk exposure across various categories (manual efforts, regulatory actions, audit failures, emergency fixes), we see a conservative total annual risk between $580,000 and $3.55M. The software's ability to automate, centralize, and provide real-time compliance status directly mitigates these risks. The rapid break-even (26 days from manual savings alone) and substantial ROI (14x conservative estimate) underscore that investing in compliant processes is not merely overhead; it is a critical, measurable business asset that safeguards capital, accelerates market access, and protects long-term viability."
