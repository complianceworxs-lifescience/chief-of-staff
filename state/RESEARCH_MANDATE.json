      "reasoning": "The requested pricing of $2000-5000+/month for a Tier III enterprise solution in Life Sciences regulatory compliance is robustly justified by the specialized and non-negotiable demands of this market. Enterprise buyers in life sciences require solutions that embed compliance, security, and auditability not as optional add-ons, but as fundamental, validated capabilities. The outlined features – from 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit trails and SOC 2 Type II certification to dedicated CSM support and comprehensive validation packages – directly address critical regulatory risks and operational bottlenecks. These elements transform compliance from a perceived overhead into a measurable business asset, enabling faster market access, ensuring data integrity, and safeguarding patient safety. The premium reflects the immense value of mitigating multi-million dollar fines, avoiding product recalls, and accelerating the development lifecycle within a highly regulated environment. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
