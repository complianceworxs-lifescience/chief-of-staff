      "reasoning": "The $2000-5000+/month pricing for a Tier III enterprise solution in Life Sciences is justified by its ability to transform compliance from a burdensome overhead into a measurable business asset. Enterprise buyers are not just purchasing software; they are investing in a de-risking strategy, operational efficiency, and a competitive advantage. The non-negotiable requirements around governance, security, and auditability reflect the immense cost of non-compliance—ranging from hefty fines and product recalls to market exclusion and reputational damage. The premium price covers specialized engineering for regulatory adherence, continuous security monitoring, robust data integrity controls, comprehensive validation support, and high-touch customer service—all designed to ensure operational continuity and accelerate regulatory approvals in a highly scrutinized environment. These features are not 'nice-to-haves'; they are critical infrastructure that enables life sciences companies to operate legally, ethically, and efficiently."
