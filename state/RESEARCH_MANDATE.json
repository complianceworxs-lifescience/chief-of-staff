      "reasoning": "The premium pricing for Tier III in Life Sciences is unequivocally justified by the integration of non-negotiable governance, security, and auditability features that fundamentally transform compliance from a cost center into a strategic business asset. These capabilities are not optional add-ons but foundational requirements that directly enable operations, reduce significant regulatory risks, safeguard critical data (IP, patient information), and accelerate time-to-market by streamlining laborious validation processes. Enterprise buyers in Life Sciences are willing to pay a premium for solutions that guarantee regulatory adherence, provide robust security, and offer comprehensive auditability, as these elements are crucial for maintaining their license to operate, fostering innovation, and protecting their brand reputation in a highly scrutinized environment. The ROI derived from avoiding penalties, accelerating validation, and ensuring data integrity far outweighs the monthly subscription cost."
