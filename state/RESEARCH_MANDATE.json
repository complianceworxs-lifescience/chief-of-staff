Enterprise buyers prioritize governance, security, and auditability not as optional features, but as foundational requirements for operating in a highly regulated environment. Features like 21 CFR Part 11 audit trails, SOC 2 Type II certification, and comprehensive validation packages directly address existential threats (regulatory fines, product recalls, operational shutdowns) while simultaneously enabling efficiency and accelerating time-to-market. The core narrative is reinforced: 'Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset' – because these investments directly translate into reduced risk, accelerated operations, and protected brand reputation, all of which have clear financial implications for large organizations."
