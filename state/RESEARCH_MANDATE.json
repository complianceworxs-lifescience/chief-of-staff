These 'alternatives' are prevalent due to historical practice, perceived lower upfront cost, and resistance to change, despite their significant hidden costs in terms of human error, inefficiency, regulatory risk, and delayed market entry. The decision to switch from these manual methods to automated software is typically triggered by critical events such as audit failures, rapid company growth, increased regulatory pressure, or a strategic mandate to leverage compliance as a business asset rather than just an overhead. Messaging should therefore focus on the profound benefits of 'beating complexity' by moving beyond these manual methods, demonstrating how a purpose-built solution transforms compliance from a cost center into a measurable driver of business value, rather than merely comparing feature sets with other software vendors."
