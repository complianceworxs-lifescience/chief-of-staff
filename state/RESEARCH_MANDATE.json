        "Strict internal IT security and compliance mandates, often driven by corporate governance or board-level directives.",
        "Need for deep, secure integration with existing enterprise systems (e.g., ERP, LIMS, QMS, clinical trial management systems).",

These capabilities are not merely 'add-ons'; they are foundational elements that transform compliance from an overhead cost into a strategic business enabler. Enterprises are willing to pay a premium because these capabilities deliver measurable value by ensuring continuous compliance, accelerating market access for regulated products, safeguarding critical assets, and providing operational resilience. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
