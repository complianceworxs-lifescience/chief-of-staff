This metric directly answers: \\n1.  **Question keeps them up at night:** Are we a bottleneck? Are we losing competitive ground due to slow compliance processes? \\n2.  **Metric makes them look smart to their boss:** It allows them to present compliance as a strategic driver of time-to-market and agility, backed by comparative data. 'We are X% faster/slower than industry peers in bringing validated products to market.'\\n3.  **Unknown creates the most anxiety:** The fear of being outpaced, of being perceived as inefficient, and of hindering business growth. \\n4.  **Would they share with colleagues:** Absolutely. It provides quantifiable data for internal discussions, advocacy for resources, or even 'bragging rights' if their velocity is high. \\nIt combines benchmarking with a dynamic, forward-looking metric, aligning perfectly with the 'Velocity' in the scorecard's name and offering immediate, high-value insight.\"\n}",

A Tier II (Velocity) solution, priced at $500-$2000/month (midpoint $1250/month), offers an immediate ROI by automating manual tasks and providing proactive insights. By preventing even a fraction of potential losses—such as saving 20% of time for just two specialists (equating to ~$48,000/year) and avoiding a single mid-level audit remediation every two years (~$75,000/year)—the solution pays for itself within weeks and delivers an exceptional annual ROI of over 8x.
