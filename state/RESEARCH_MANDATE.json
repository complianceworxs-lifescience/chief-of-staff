      "reasoning": "The premium pricing for Tier III (Asset/Enterprise) is unequivocally justified by the non-negotiable requirements of Life Sciences enterprises for governance, security, and auditability. These organizations operate in a highly regulated environment where non-compliance carries severe financial penalties, reputational damage, and even patient harm. Features like 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit trails, SOC 2 Type II, granular RBAC, data residency, and validation support are not 'nice-to-haves' but foundational elements for operational legality and integrity. The dedicated support and robust SLAs further de-risk the adoption of external solutions, directly translating into tangible value: reduced internal validation costs, accelerated time-to-market for regulated products, and ultimately, the transformation of compliance from a perceived overhead into a measurable business asset and strategic differentiator. Buyers are willing to pay a premium because these capabilities directly mitigate existential business risks and enable core business functions to operate compliantly and efficiently at scale."
