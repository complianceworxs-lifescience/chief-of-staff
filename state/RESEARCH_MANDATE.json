These methods, despite their initial low explicit cost, incur significant hidden costs related to inefficiency, human error, audit risk, and lack of scalability. The analysis of alternatives focuses on identifying these pervasive methods, their deep-seated weaknesses (hidden costs), and the critical triggers that compel organizations to seek automated solutions.
