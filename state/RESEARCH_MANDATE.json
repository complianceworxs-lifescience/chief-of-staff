      "reasoning": "Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset. For Tier III enterprise buyers in Life Sciences, the premium price for regulatory compliance software is not just about features, but about the profound reduction of operational, legal, and financial risk, combined with acceleration of critical business functions like clinical trials and market access. The non-negotiable security, auditability, and service level guarantees directly translate into reduced costs associated with non-compliance, faster time-to-market for products, and greater operational efficiency. These capabilities safeguard revenue, protect reputation, and are fundamental enablers of their core business, making the investment justifiable and essential."
