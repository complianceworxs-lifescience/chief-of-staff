The mandatory features such as 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit trails, SOC 2 Type II certification, and comprehensive validation documentation directly address non-negotiable regulatory demands that underpin every aspect of pharmaceutical and biotech operations. These features require substantial, continuous investment in specialized architectural design, development, rigorous auditing, and expert talent, all of which justify a premium. Furthermore, enterprise-grade service levels, granular data residency options, and seamless integration capabilities deliver critical operational efficiency and strategic value that generic solutions cannot. The actual cost of non-compliance, data breaches, or operational downtime far exceeds the investment in a compliant, robust, and expertly supported platform, making these 'must-have' features the primary drivers for premium pricing. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
