The weaknesses of these alternatives, such as human error, lack of audit trails, and scalability issues, directly correspond to the triggers that push organizations to seek automated solutions. The messaging implications focus on leveraging this understanding: by directly addressing the complexity and hidden costs of manual processes, and framing compliance software as a strategic business asset rather than merely an overhead expense, vendors can differentiate themselves from both manual alternatives and other software providers.
