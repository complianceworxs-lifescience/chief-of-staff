      "reasoning": "The premium pricing for Tier III (Asset/Enterprise) in Life Sciences regulatory compliance is justified by delivering non-negotiable, mission-critical features that transform compliance from a cost center into a strategic business asset. Enterprises in this sector demand robust, validated solutions that not only meet stringent regulatory mandates like 21 CFR Part 11, GxP, and data residency requirements but also provide superior security (SOC 2 Type II, SSO, RBAC), comprehensive auditability, and dedicated, expert-level support. These capabilities directly mitigate catastrophic regulatory risks, accelerate time-to-market, protect intellectual property, and significantly reduce operational overhead associated with internal compliance efforts, making the investment a measurable driver of business value and resilience."
