These figures represent the direct and indirect financial repercussions of inadequate compliance oversight.

      "reasoning": "Enterprise Life Sciences organizations operate under an exceptionally high level of regulatory scrutiny, where the cost of non-compliance is catastrophic. The features outlined – particularly the advanced security, comprehensive auditability, and dedicated regulatory adherence mechanisms – are not optional enhancements but foundational requirements. They directly address the critical risks of data integrity breaches, regulatory fines, operational shutdowns, and reputational damage. By investing in a Tier III solution with these capabilities, enterprises effectively transform compliance from a reactive overhead into a proactive, measurable business asset. This drives quantifiable value through risk mitigation, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access, thereby fully justifying the premium $2000-5000+/month pricing model."
