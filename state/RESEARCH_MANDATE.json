The 'totalAnnualRisk' sums the lower and upper bounds of these potential costs. The 'timeWasted' estimation is based on the provided context of 20-40% validation team time loss. The 'regulatoryPenalties' section details specific financial and reputational consequences. The 'priceJustification' metrics (break-even days, ROI multiple) are derived from the lower bound of potential savings and risk mitigation, demonstrating quick value realization.

These features are not merely 'add-ons' but foundational elements that transform compliance from a cost center into a measurable business asset. Enterprises in Life Sciences cannot afford the risks associated with non-compliance; therefore, investing in a solution that proactively manages these risks, streamlines validation, and ensures data integrity is paramount. The features outlined directly address core regulatory mandates and enterprise security postures, providing indispensable value that far outweighs the monthly subscription cost by preventing fines, accelerating market entry, and safeguarding invaluable intellectual property and patient data. Buyers are willing to pay more because these features are critical enablers for their regulated operations, reducing their overall cost of compliance and risk."
