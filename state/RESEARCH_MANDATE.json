      "reasoning": "The premium pricing for Tier III (Enterprise) life sciences regulatory compliance software is unequivocally justified by the non-negotiable requirements for governance, security, and auditability. These features are not merely 'overhead'; they are foundational business assets that directly enable market access, mitigate existential risk, and ensure the integrity of critical processes and data. Enterprises in this sector operate under immense regulatory scrutiny, where the cost of non-compliance far outweighs the investment in robust, compliant solutions. The ability to demonstrate a fully validated, secure, and auditable system is paramount, transforming compliance into a measurable accelerator for product development and market leadership."
