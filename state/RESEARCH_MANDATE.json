For 'Time lost to manual tracking', we estimate a conservative 3-person validation team, each earning $60/hour (loaded), wasting 30% of their time on manual tasks, totaling ~$112k annually. 'Regulatory penalties and warning letters' are scaled down from the $10M+ context, focusing on the substantial remediation effort required for even a smaller entity (estimated at $0.5M-$2M), separate from an initial 'warningLetterCost' for immediate assessment. 'Delayed product launches' reflect potential revenue loss for products generating $5M-$20M annually if delayed by 3-6 months. 'Audit failures' encompass internal resource redirection and external consultant fees, distinct from full Warning Letters. 'Consultant fees' represent reactive engagements at high hourly rates. The 'totalAnnualRisk' is a sum of these categories.

'Regulatory penalties and warning letters' are scaled down from the $10M+ context, focusing on the substantial remediation effort required for even a smaller entity (estimated at $0.5M-$2M), separate from an initial 'warningLetterCost' for immediate assessment. 'Delayed product launches' reflect potential revenue loss for products generating $5M-$20M annually if delayed by 3-6 months. 'Audit failures' encompass internal resource redirection and external consultant fees, distinct from full Warning Letters. 'Consultant fees' represent reactive engagements at high hourly rates. The 'totalAnnualRisk' is a sum of these categories. The price justification highlights that even a conservative estimate of time savings and minor risk mitigation (e.g., 25% of time waste + 5% reduction in audit failure risk) provides a clear ROI for a ~$1,000/month solution, turning compliance from a cost center into a strategic investment that safeguards revenue and reputation."
