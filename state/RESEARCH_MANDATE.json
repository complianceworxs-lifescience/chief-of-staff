      "reasoning": "The provided Tier III pricing ($2000-5000+/month) is demonstrably justified by the non-negotiable enterprise requirements in Life Sciences. The core narrative, 'Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset,' is reinforced through every identified feature. These are not merely 'add-ons' but foundational elements that directly mitigate immense regulatory, financial, and reputational risks. Enterprise buyers pay a premium for solutions that de-risk their operations, accelerate their compliance efforts, and provide tangible efficiency gains. The robust security, granular auditability, and guaranteed service levels transform a potential liability into a strategic advantage, making these features indispensable and validating the high price point as an investment rather than a cost."
