While seemingly 'free' or low-cost on the surface, these alternatives carry immense hidden costs in terms of labor inefficiency, data integrity risks, audit failures, delayed time-to-market, and potential regulatory fines. The complexity inherent in managing compliance manually becomes a critical business bottleneck, turning compliance into an operational overhead rather than a strategic asset. The trigger for switching typically comes from a breaking point – an audit finding, unsustainable growth, or a strategic mandate for digital transformation. Messaging should therefore focus on beating this complexity, highlighting the measurable business value and strategic asset potential of a purpose-built compliance solution, rather than getting bogged down in feature-for-feature comparisons with other software vendors."
