      "reasoning": "The $2000-5000+/month pricing for a Tier III enterprise solution in Life Sciences regulatory compliance is primarily justified by its ability to transform compliance from a cost center into a strategic business asset. Enterprises in this sector face existential risks from non-compliance, data breaches, and operational disruptions. The mandatory features and service levels at this tier directly address these risks, offering robust governance, impenetrable security, and irrefutable auditability. These capabilities not only ensure adherence to stringent regulations like 21 CFR Part 11, GxP, and data residency laws but also drastically reduce the internal effort, time, and cost associated with validation, audits, and security due diligence. Buyers pay a premium because these features enable them to operate globally, accelerate market entry, protect valuable IP and patient data, and maintain continuous operational integrity without diverting critical resources to building or managing complex compliance infrastructure internally. The value proposition is not merely compliance; it's operational excellence and competitive advantage in a highly regulated landscape. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
