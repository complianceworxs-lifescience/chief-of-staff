      "problem": "You're spending 3 months validating a system that will be updated in 6 months. Your documentation is thicker than your user requirements. And regulators? They're asking for risk-based approaches while you're still writing IQ/OQ/PQ protocols from 2010.",
      "agitate": "Meanwhile, your competitors are validating faster, with less documentation, AND getting cleaner audit findings. They're not cutting corners—they're following GAMP 5 2nd Edition while you're stuck in the past. Every month you wait, you're burning budget on activities that don't actually reduce risk.",

      "agitate": "Here's what keeps Heads of Quality up at night: FDA is actively promoting risk-based approaches. EU Annex 11 practically demands it.
