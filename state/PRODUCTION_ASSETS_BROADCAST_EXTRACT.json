It highlights the\n5 evidence gaps auditors are hunting for right now.\n\n[DOWNLOAD THE CHECKLIST]\nhttps://your-link-here.com/audit-checklist\n\nQuestion for you: Are you still taking screenshots\nmanually, or have you moved to automated evidence\ncapture yet?\n\nIf you'd like the checklist, just reply \"send it\" and\nI'll get it right over.\n\nhttps://your-link-here.com/audit-checklist\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
