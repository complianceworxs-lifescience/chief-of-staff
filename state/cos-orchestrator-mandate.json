All actions must optimize for conversion to paid value.\n• All agent actions must have a clear connection to revenue metrics. Add revenueImpact with estimated value, or clearly state ARR/MRR/pipeline impact.\n• L7 Master Directive requires all actions to have a minimum 7-day revenue probability of 15%. Add revenueImpact with confidence >= 0.15.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════\nSUGGESTED REVENUE-ALIGNED REWORD\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════\nORIGINAL: \"STRATEGIC RECOVERY: Expand Content Marketing Reach by 40%\"\nREWORD TO:\n\nACTION: \"Convert content audience to pipeline opportunities\"\nDESCRIPTION: \"Deploy targeted content sequence to convert 40 engaged readers into qualified demo requests, targeting 5% conversion rate\"\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: \"Generate $15,000 in new pipeline value through content-driven lead qualification\"\nREVENUE IMPACT: { type: \"pipeline\", estimatedValue: 15000, confidence: 0.7 }\n\nWHY THIS WORKS:\n• Focuses on conversion (readers → demo requests) not reach\n• Ties directly to pipeline value ($15,000)\n• Measurable outcome with specific conversion target (5%)\n\nRESUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Use the suggested reword above as your new action\n2. Ensure you include specific revenue targets (ARR/MRR/pipeline $)\n3. Focus on conversion outcomes, not engagement metrics\n4. Resubmit through the standard action flow\n\nThe CoS will automatically approve revenue-aligned actions.",
