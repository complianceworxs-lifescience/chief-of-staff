All actions must optimize for conversion to paid value.\n• All agent actions must have a clear connection to revenue metrics. Add revenueImpact with estimated value, or clearly state ARR/MRR/pipeline impact.\n\nGUIDANCE:\nAll actions must:\n1. Produce measurable revenue impact (ARR/MRR/pipeline)\n2. Support the 3-layer revenue engine (Strategic → CMO → CRO)\n3. Optimize for conversion, not engagement\n4. Reject noise-producing tactics\n\nPlease adjust your action to meet these constraints and resubmit.",
