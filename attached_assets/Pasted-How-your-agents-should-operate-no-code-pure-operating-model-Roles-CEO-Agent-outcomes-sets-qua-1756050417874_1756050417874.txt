How your agents should operate (no code, pure operating model)
Roles

CEO Agent (outcomes): sets quarterly KPIs (e.g., “+20% revenue/visitor; MTTR <5m”); updates guardrails only.

Chief of Staff Agent (ops owner): runs the loop daily, enforces guardrails, escalates per policy.

CMO/CRO Agents (domain owners): propose experiments; accept winners; request follow-ups to compound gains.

Daily Loop (agent-run)

Pick targets (top pages/offers with most revenue potential).

Define experiment (small, fast, high-impact).

Hypothesis, primary metric = revenue; secondary = CTR / checkout start.

Guardrails: stop if bounce ↑ >10% or rev/visit ↓ >5% over 24h.

Allocate traffic with bandit policy (start 50/50, then favor winner).

Attribute events: every view/click/checkout/purchase is logged with {exp_id, variant, session_id, $value}.

Early stops: auto-kill losers quickly (e.g., after 120 sessions if below control and failing guardrails).

Promote winners: ship winning variant, tag it with exp_id for lineage.

Write to Playbook: append “What worked / Where / Why / Evidence / Next test.”

Predictive watch: detect 3-day EMA drift vs 14-day baseline; preemptively open a new experiment when drift > threshold.

What’s tracked (always revenue-tied)

Primary: revenue/visit, total revenue per variant, purchase rate.

Secondary: primary CTA CTR, checkout start rate, time on page, bounce.

Ops: time to detect/stop losers, % auto-promoted winners, experiment cycle time.

Guardrails (own outcomes, stay safe)

Max 3 active experiments/day across site.

No edits to legal/pricing without CEO sign-off.

Stop any variant that drops rev/visit >5% over 24h or bounce >75%.

Enforce mobile first: CLS ≤ 0.1, LCP ≤ 3s.

Artifacts the agents must produce
1) Experiment Card (one per test)

ID: exp_YYYY_MM_area_goal

Hypothesis: “Benefit-led CTA increases rev/visit.”

Target: /membership-pricing

Primary metric: revenue

Variants: A (control), B (benefit CTA)

Guardrails: see above

Start/Stop: timestamps

Decision: Winner + reason + evidence

2) Attribution Ledger (append-only)

Rows like:
{ts, exp_id, variant, event, value, session_id, path}
So you can say “Variant B generated $1,274 this week.”

3) Self-Writing Playbook (living doc)

Each completed experiment adds:

Pattern: “Benefit > Feature in pricing CTAs”

Where it worked: pricing, partners page

Audience notes: Validation Strategist > Rising Leader

Next move: try “risk-reduction” framing on checkout

4) Predictive Alerts

“EMA drift: pricing page purchase rate −18% vs 14-day; launch headline contrast test now.”

5) Weekly CEO Brief (1 page)

Revenue impact from last week’s winners

Experiments shipped/failed, cycle time

Risks + next week’s focus

Simple responsibilities

CEO Agent: set KPIs + guardrails, review weekly brief.

CoS Agent: run daily loop, enforce rules, escalate per triggers.

CMO/CRO Agents: design next experiments from the playbook, accept/promote winners, queue follow-ups.

Templates (copy these into your agent directives)
Outcome charter

North Star: increase revenue/visit by +20% this quarter.

Daily cap: ≤3 experiments, ≤1 on any single page.

Stop rules: loser after 120 sessions or guardrail breach.

Promote rules: winner after p≈0.9 or +10% rev/visit for 48h.

Playbook rule: every decision updates the playbook with pattern + next test.
