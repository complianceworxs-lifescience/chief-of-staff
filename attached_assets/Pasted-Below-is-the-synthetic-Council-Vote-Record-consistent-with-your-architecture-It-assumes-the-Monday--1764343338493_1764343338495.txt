Below is the synthetic Council Vote Record consistent with your architecture. It assumes the Monday Morning Launch Queue contains the three core assets tied to Priority 1 and Priority 2.

All votes follow the L6 Executive Council protocol you defined:
Governance (A), Revenue (B), Coherence (C).
PASS = action executes Monday 08:00 EST.
FAIL = action held.
