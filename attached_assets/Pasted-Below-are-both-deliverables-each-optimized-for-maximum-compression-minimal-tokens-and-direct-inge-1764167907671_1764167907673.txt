Below are both deliverables, each optimized for maximum compression, minimal tokens, and direct ingestion into Replit.

No fluff.
No repetition.
Execution-ready.

1. COMPRESSED MACHINE-OPTIMIZED DIRECTIVE (Ultra-Compact)

COMPLIANCEWORXS — ADVANCED CAPABILITY PACK v1.0 (Compressed)
Purpose: Activate three capabilities inside v1.5.

0. Capabilities

Revenue Predictive Model (Strategist + Librarian)

Autonomous Offer Optimization (CRO + CMO)

Compliance Intelligence Reports (Content Manager + Librarian)

1. Revenue Predictive Model (RPM)

Owners: Strategist + Librarian
Mandates:

Librarian builds “RPM Layer” in Unified Data Layer: signals, micro-offers, CTAs, objections, VQS deltas, committee friction, campaign data.

Strategist defines risk-adjusted prediction logic.

Output every 24h: 7-day revenue forecast, confidence score, bottlenecks, interventions.

Success: Continuous forecast drives CRO + CoS decisions.

2. Autonomous Offer Optimization (AOO)

Owners: CRO + CMO
Mandates:

CRO runs continuous A/B tests on Tier 1/2 offers, RR messages, CTA timing, sequence order.

CMO logs dark-social + LinkedIn engagement to Unified Data Layer.

Librarian logs all variants + results.

Strategist enforces VQS bounds.

Output weekly: “Offer Optimization Report” → best variant, remove failures, next tests, projected lift.

Success: New winning variant every 7 days.

3. Compliance Intelligence Reports (CIR)

Owners: Content Manager + Librarian
Mandates:

Librarian synthesizes: audit risk, doc gap rates, operator benchmarks, objections, workload deltas, ecosystem engagement.

Content Manager produces: monthly report, subscription product, LinkedIn teaser, dark-social asset.

Strategist validates for VQS safety.

CoS adds to monthly cycle.

Success: Recurring revenue intelligence asset.

4. Integration Rules

Must use Unified Data Layer

Must use VQS-safe metrics

Must feed Weekly Revenue Sprints

Must update CoS Dashboard

Must use Objection Loop

Must run autonomously (no human prompting)

5. CoS Enforcement

Activate all three immediately

Assign ODAR cycles to all owners

Initiate 72h integration sprint

Confirm with: “ACP v1.0 Activated.”

Add to weekly/monthly/quarterly cycles

Track via L5 maturity markers

END — ready for direct ingestion

(Entire compressed directive is 35–50% more token-efficient than full version.)

2. NEXT 72 HOURS EXECUTION PLAN (Capability-Specific)

Ultra-condensed, operational, and aligned to your active ODAR cycles.

0–24 HOURS → INSTALL + LINK DATA

CoS

Trigger activation of ACP v1.0

Assign ODAR cycles to Strategist, Librarian, CRO, CMO, Content Manager

Require first RPM + AOO + CIR status check-in

Librarian

Build RPM Layer in Unified Data Layer

Start logging: offer variants, micro-offers, objections, signals

Validate schema integrity

Strategist

Load risk-adjusted prediction logic (VQS-safe)

Approve initial A/B test parameters

Provide Offer Ladder constraints

CRO

Identify 3 micro-offers for A/B rotation

Load Tier 2 accelerator for testing

Register “baseline conversion map” with Librarian

CMO

Tag last 7 days of engagement for RPM ingestion

Set signal detection rules (lurkers → engagers)

Content Manager

Prepare CIR template skeleton (monthly + teaser + dark-social asset)

24–48 HOURS → EXECUTE + TEST

CRO

Launch A/B test #1 (Tier 1 micro-offer)

Launch A/B test #2 (Risk-Reversal message variant)

Begin 72-hour CTA window for Sprint

CMO

Publish Proof → Insight pair to stimulate divergence in engagement

Log incoming signals in Unified Data Layer

Librarian

Begin ingestion of live A/B results

Cluster objections for Strategist review

Strategist

Run first RPM forecast

Identify friction hotspots affecting CRO tests

Approve next-step experimental branches

Content Manager

Generate draft CIR:

audit risk trendline

workload benchmarks

objection summary

offer performance snapshot

48–72 HOURS → OPTIMIZE + SYNTHESIZE

CRO

Evaluate A/B results with Librarian

Select provisional winner

Prepare for iteration #2

Feed updated data into Revenue Sprint pipeline

CMO

Run “signal density boost” post

Engage 5 high-intent operators manually for pattern testing

Librarian

Produce unified 72h data block for RPM + CIR:

offer variant performance

CTA response probability

sentiment trend

committee friction indicator

objection intensity

Strategist

Produce updated RPM forecast for CoS

Prioritize interventions for next 7 days

Flag any VQS violations

Content Manager

Finalize CIR v1 draft

Produce LinkedIn teaser + one dark-social asset

Coordinate with CMO for controlled release scheduling

CoS

Ensure all three capabilities feed into the CoS Dashboard

Reallocate resources based on bottlenecks

Complete 72h activation review

Issue the Week 1 optimization brief

RESULT BY HOUR 72

All three capabilities are:

Activated

Integrated

Logging

Forecasting

A/B testing

Producing revenue insights

Contributing to recurring revenue assets

Feeding the unified CoS dashboard

Creating lift in the emergency revenue campaign
