0) What this dashboard must do

Synthesize cross‑agent signals into 5 clear executive KPIs.

Surface the right few decisions, risks, and opportunities each day.

Drive action via proactive tasking, comms, and calendar management.

Bridge communication across agents with concise meeting synths and drafts.

Adapt to stage of growth (weights, thresholds, initiatives are configurable).

Health (0–100) + RAG, Milestone forecast, Path‑to‑Green (1–3 tasks), Risks & Dependencies (owner/date), Attribution (which agent owns next step).

D) Communication Bridge

Meeting Synth & Actions: last meeting → 3 bullets max + assigned actions (owner, ETA, status). Unowned for >2h → auto‑assign via matrix.

Drafts & Outreach: ready‑to‑send drafts (investor update, customer note, partner follow‑up, internal directive). Buttons: Send as CEO, Send as CoS, Request edit.

Escalation Ladder: Item misses SLA → escalate Owner → Lead → CEO. Timer visible.

E) Intelligence → Insight → Directive

Insight Cards (auto‑curated): e.g., OpenAI‑critique posts +19% ER → +3 paid yesterday.

Directive Builder: e.g., Double cadence on this topic for 72h • Owner: CMO • Budget: +$X → Send (creates tasks + notifications).

F) Alerts & Guardrails

Decision Debt: count of CEO‑required decisions; red if >3 or any >24h old.

Runway Actions: Revenue Pace Red for 2 days → propose 2 levers (pricing/promo/partner push).

Compliance Clock: next audit/SOP due; if <7 days and not Green → escalate to CCO.

G) Data Contracts (JSON payloads)

These minimal contracts are produced daily/continuously by feeder agents. CoS validates before render. On validation failure: send a red “DATA GAP” alert to COO + offending agent with missing field list.
