I. Automation Rules (CoS should execute, not just report)

Proactive tasking: If a meeting action has no owner in 2h → auto-assign via ownership matrix and notify in Slack/Email.

Calendar triage: If a decision is due within 4h and CEO is in back-to-backs → CoS auto-moves the lowest-value meeting and inserts a 10-min “Decision Block”.

Directive dispatch: When an insight passes a threshold (e.g., ER Δ ≥ +15%), CoS drafts a directive and routes to CMO/CRO for execution with prefilled context and links.

Escalation: If any initiative turns Red or Risk Clock < 72h, create a “Path-to-Green” task group and start the escalation ladder automatically.

Weekly synthesis: Each Friday 3pm, CoS auto-generates a 5-slide board brief (revenue pacing, initiative health, risks, decisions, plan).

Style: same visual system you’re using (rounded cards, soft shadows), but fewer widgets, more decisions. Mobile: collapse RAG→accordion; keep the Top Strip always visible.

K. Success Criteria (how we know it’s working)

CEO can make/clear 90% of daily decisions in ≤ 10 minutes.

Decision Debt ≤ 3, average age < 24h.

Initiative Health trending up (≥ +10 points over 14 days).

Alignment ≥ 85%, Autonomy ≥ 90%, MTTR < 5 min.

Revenue Pace holds Green 4 of 5 days/week.
