here’s a clean, execution-ready Hybrid Polling vs. Event-Driven Map for ComplianceWorxs. It shows what should be webhook/push-driven (no polling), what can safely run at 10 polls/day, and where you need higher-urgency fallbacks.

Hybrid Trigger Map (by Agent)
CRO Agent — Revenue & Upsells (Keep responsive)

Event-driven (use webhooks; no polling):

Stripe: checkout.session.completed, invoice.payment_succeeded/failed, customer.subscription.updated/deleted

MemberPress / WP: “subscription created/updated/canceled,” “member status changed” (use WP hooks or MemberPress webhooks)

Fluent Forms: “lead submitted,” “quiz completed,” “segment assigned”

Polling fallback (max 10/day):

Revenue attribution reconciliation (Stripe ↔ MemberPress ↔ internal).

Partner referral checks if no webhook available.

If only 10/day: Slower attribution and upsell trigger latency (2–3h).
SLA: Payment & cancellation actions must arrive via webhooks → 0–5 min reaction; reconciliation OK at ~2–3h.

CMO Agent — Marketing & Nurture (OK at 10/day)

Event-driven:

MailerLite: subscriber added/updated, campaign sent, automation step completed

Fluent Forms: segmentation outcomes, content requests

WordPress: post published/updated (hook)

Polling fallback (10/day):

Channel analytics pulls (LinkedIn, blog traffic snapshots), UTMs, share metrics.

Creative A/B rollups.

If only 10/day: Nurture steps based purely on analytics timestamps lag; email series still instant if automation is MailerLite-driven.
SLA: Nurture sends via MailerLite automations = instant; analytics rollups q2.5h fine.

COO Agent — Onboarding & Ops (Mix: webhooks + faster fallback)

Event-driven:

Fluent Forms: onboarding step submissions

MemberPress/Stripe: activation, plan change

WP: role changed, access granted

Polling fallback:

Onboarding health check every 30–60 min (exception to 10/day) until step-3 bug is fully eliminated.

Daily SLA sweeps: missing access, failed provisioning, stuck steps (10/day OK).

If only 10/day: Onboarding breakages could linger 2–3h.
SLA: Critical onboarding validation every 30–60 min (or event-driven); routine sweeps 10/day.

CCO Agent — Compliance & Governance (10/day OK)

Event-driven:

SOP/version update events, validation checklist submissions (via forms/hooks)

Polling fallback (10/day):

Audit-trail integrity scans, diff checks, evidence packaging status.
If only 10/day: Fine—compliance artifacts aren’t minute-critical.
SLA: Evidence completeness checks daily; exception alerts via webhooks immediately.

CEO Agent — Strategy & OKR pacing (10/day ideal)

Event-driven:

Signals from CRO/COO/CMO when KPIs cross thresholds (push a “pacing_updated” event)

Polling fallback (10/day):

Recompute glidepaths, deltas, forecast risk.
If only 10/day: Perfectly fine for exec pacing.
SLA: Update OKR pacing every ~2–3h or on push.

Content Manager Agent — Publishing Flow (10/day)

Event-driven:

WP post/page publish/update, asset upload complete
Polling fallback (10/day):

Link checks, image alt/a11y audits, metadata QA
If only 10/day: Fine; content QA not time-critical.
SLA: Pre-publish checks at event time; post-publish sweep within 2–3h.

Market Intelligence Agent — External Signals (10/day)

Event-driven:

If any third-party sends push notifications (rare)

Polling fallback (10/day):

Trends, competitor pages, partner listings, keyword ranks (where allowed)
If only 10/day: Fine for weekly reporting.
SLA: At most every 2–3h; high-cost jobs can be 2–4/day.

Chief of Staff — Orchestration (10/day)

Event-driven:

Listen to all agents’ “state_changed” / “error_raised” / “kpi_crossed” events
Polling fallback (10/day):

Produce weekly JSON + dashboard refreshes, reconcile missing events.
SLA: Decision queues and escalations fire on push; weekly compilation runs on schedule.

Alerting & SLOs (keep these even at 10/day)

Payments & Cancels (CRO): webhook → alert if not processed in <5 min.

Onboarding criticals (COO): webhook or ≤60 min poll; alert if step fails twice.

MTTR Targets: CRO <30 min, COO <60 min, others <2–3h.

Autonomy Health: Auto-resolve ≥ 85%, escalation ≤ 5/day.

Cost Guardrails: If token/compute > +20% WoW, scale back Market Intel sampling before anything revenue-touching.
