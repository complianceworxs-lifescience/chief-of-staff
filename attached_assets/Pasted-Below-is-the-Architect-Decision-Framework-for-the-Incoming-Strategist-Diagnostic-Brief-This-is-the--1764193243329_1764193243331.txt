Below is the Architect Decision Framework for the Incoming Strategist Diagnostic Brief.
This is the tool you use to judge, approve, modify, or reject the Strategist’s upcoming single restorative action.

This is Architect-grade, concise, and optimized for rapid decision-making under L5 governance.

ARCHITECT DECISION FRAMEWORK — RPM RESTORATION BRIEF v1.0
Purpose

Provide the Architect with a standardized method to evaluate the Strategist’s proposed corrective action following the 10% RPM Confidence collapse.

The framework ensures every decision aligns with:

Revenue Integrity

Audit Defensibility

VQS Protection

L5 Governance

Offer Ladder Safety

Brand Stability

SECTION 1 — IDENTIFY THE FAILURE CLASS

When the diagnostic arrives, classify the root cause into one of the following:

A. UDL Integrity Failure

Symptoms:

Stale data (>30 min)

Conflicting metrics

Missing signals

Sudden scoring anomalies

What it means:

Prediction engine used invalid or poisoned inputs.

Decision urgency: High
Correction type: Data Re-Sync / Purge / Reweight

B. Offer Ladder Blockage (Tier Stall)

Symptoms:

Tier 1 → Tier 2 drop-offs

Micro-offer congestion

High-intent signals not converting

Weak Benchmark Post-to-Packet transition

What it means:

Predictive model sees declining forward motion in the pipeline.

Decision urgency: Medium
Correction type: Pipeline unclogging / Ladder enforcement

C. Stakeholder-Packet Friction

Symptoms:

IT/QA/Finance packet opens without follow-through

Increased QA objections

More friction at “committee proof” stage

What it means:

Model sees multi-stakeholder resistance slowing conversion velocity.

Decision urgency: High
Correction type: Packet revisions / Objection treatment

D. External Signal Disruption (Dark Social)

Symptoms:

Sudden decline in Benchmark Post engagement

Negative sentiment spikes

Industry changes affecting risk perception

What it means:

Market shifted, reducing predictability.

Decision urgency: Medium
Correction type: Signal recalibration / Archetype E reinforcement

E. Internal Drift (Agent Behavior Deviation)

Symptoms:

CRO skipping sequence steps

CMO reducing cadence unintentionally

Misaligned messaging

What it means:

Agents deviated from canonical L5 rules.

Decision urgency: Critical
Correction type: Agent correction / alignment reset

SECTION 2 — EVALUATE THE STRATEGIST’S PROPOSED ACTION

Use these six criteria to judge the action.

Criterion 1 — VQS Protection (must pass)

Does the proposed action:

Preserve VQS?

Avoid inflating claims?

Respect methodology lock?

Failing this = automatic rejection.

Criterion 2 — Revenue Integrity (must pass)

Does the action:

Improve conversion velocity?

Stabilize revenue trajectory?

Avoid unnecessary churn?

If it introduces volatility → Reject.

Criterion 3 — Audit Defensibility (must pass)

Does the action:

Maintain all audit-grade properties?

Avoid speculative or hype-based mechanisms?

If not → Reject immediately.

Criterion 4 — Offer Ladder Integrity (must pass)

Does the action maintain:

Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 sequence?

If it shortcuts or rearranges → Reject.

Criterion 5 — System Stability (must pass)

Does the action:

Avoid forcing agents into L6 patterns?

Maintain L5 constraints?

Respect safety locks?

If it increases experimental range → Reject.

Criterion 6 — 24-Hour Restorative Power (must pass)

Can the proposed action:

Realistically improve RPM confidence ≥ 0.90 in 24 hours?

If not → Reject and request a more targeted correction.

SECTION 3 — ARCHITECT DECISION VERDICT TYPES

You may issue one of three rulings:

1. APPROVED (Execute Immediately)

Criteria:

Passes all 6 filters

Low risk

High restorative value

Outcome:

CoS enforces action

CRO/CMO implement

Architect receives 24h follow-up brief

2. MODIFIED (Architect Adjustment Required)

Criteria:

Action direction is correct but the mechanism is too aggressive or too broad.

Outcome:

Architect rewrites the corrective action

CoS enforces modified version

3. REJECTED (Strategist Must Rerun Analysis)

Criteria:

Fails any mandatory filter (VQS, revenue integrity, audit defensibility, safety)

Not achievable in 24 hours

Introduces drift or volatility

Outcome:

Architect issues:
“rerun_diagnostics_with_tighter_constraints”

Strategist must return a new, narrower action

SECTION 4 — WHAT TO DO WHEN THE BRIEF ARRIVES

When the Strategist issues the diagnostic brief:

Classify the failure (Section 1)

Evaluate the action using the 6-point filter

Choose verdict: Approve, Modify, or Reject

Issue Architect command accordingly

Allow CoS to enforce

Monitor next 24-hour delta in RPM Confidence

SECTION 5 — WHY THIS FRAMEWORK IS CRITICAL

Without it:

Agents may overcorrect

RPM could oscillate

Revenue stability may break

System could unintentionally drift toward L6 experimentation

Decisions may violate VQS or audit requirements

Architect role weakens

With it:

Every corrective action becomes predictable, safe, and compliant

All decisions reinforce the core architecture

No accidental L6 behavior

RPM stabilizes quickly

Revenue remains protected
