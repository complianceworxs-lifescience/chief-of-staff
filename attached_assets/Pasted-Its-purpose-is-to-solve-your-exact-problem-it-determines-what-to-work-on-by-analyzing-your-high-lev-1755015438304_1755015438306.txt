Its purpose is to solve your exact problem: it determines what to work on by analyzing your high-level goals against real-time business data, and then it tells the team of AI agents what to do by generating a prioritized list of clear, actionable directives.
It sits above your other agents (CRO, CFO, COO, CCO) and conducts them like an orchestra.

How the Chief of Staff Agent Would Work
It would have three core functions: Ingest, Analyze, and Delegate.
1. Ingest & Synthesize Data (The Senses)
This agent would be the only agent that connects to all other data sources to build a complete picture of the business. Its inputs would be:
•	Your High-Level Goals: You would tell Orion your primary objectives (e.g., "Achieve $100k in new revenue by Oct 31," or "Successfully onboard two new AIP partners by year-end").
•	Performance Feeds from Other Agents: It would continuously pull data from your executive team:
o	CRO Agent: Real-time lead flow, trial signups, pipeline status.
o	CFO Agent: Campaign spend, cost per acquisition, profit margins on closed deals.
o	COO Agent: Partner capacity (available hours), project completion status.
o	CCO Agent: Compliance status, upcoming audit dates.
2. Analyze & Prioritize (The Brain)
This is the Chief of Staff’s key function. It takes all the data and uses a prioritization framework to decide what's most important right now.
•	Goal vs. Reality Check: It constantly compares your goals to the real-time data. For example: "Our revenue goal requires 30 trial signups, but we only have 12. Therefore, increasing trial signups is the top priority."
•	Impact vs. Effort Scoring: For every potential task (like launching a new campaign, developing a new feature, etc.), Orion would score it based on:
o	Impact: How much does this task contribute to a primary goal? (High/Medium/Low)
o	Effort: How many resources (money, partner hours) does it require? (High/Medium/Low)
•	The Output: The Prioritized Backlog: It generates a simple, ranked list of initiatives. For example:
1.	[P1] Launch "Validation Velocity" Campaign (High Impact, Medium Effort)
2.	[P2] Onboard New EDP Partner (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
3.	[P3] Explore Coda Integration (Low Impact, Medium Effort)
3. Delegate & Direct (The Voice)
This is where the Chief of Staff agent directly answers your question. It presents you with its findings and then translates the top priority into concrete commands for the other agents.
Example: A "Monday Morning Strategy Brief" Generated by Orion
Orion Strategic Brief: Week of August 12, 2025
Analysis: We are currently at $25,000 of our $100,000 revenue goal. At the current rate of trial signups (2 per week), we will miss our target. The highest-impact action is to accelerate the "Validation Velocity" campaign.
This Week's Top Priority: Drive 5 new qualified trial signups.
Generated Directives for Executive Agents:
•	Directive for CRO Agent:
o	Action: Execute Phase 2 of the "Validation Velocity" email nurture sequence to the existing lead list.
o	Goal: Convert at least 2 leads from the list into trials.
•	Directive for CFO Agent:
o	Action: Allocate a $750 ad budget for the "Direct Offer" LinkedIn campaign.
o	Goal: Generate 3 new trials at a Cost Per Acquisition below $250.
•	Directive for COO Agent:
o	Action: Ensure the EDP has 40 hours of capacity available this week to service potential new "UAT Evidence Pack" orders from trial conversions.
By increasing this agent’s capabilities, you are building a system to take the strategic and delegative load off your plate. You simply set the high-level goals, and the Chief of Staff agents does the work of figuring out the "what" and "who" to ensure your entire AI team is always working on the most important thing to move your business forward.
