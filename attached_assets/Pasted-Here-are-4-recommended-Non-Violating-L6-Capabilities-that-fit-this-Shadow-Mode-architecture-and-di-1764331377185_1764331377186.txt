Here are 4 recommended Non-Violating L6 Capabilities that fit this "Shadow Mode" architecture and directly support your "Revenue Prime" directive for Monday:

1. The "Propensity-to-Pay" Scorer (Predictive Layer)
Concept: Instead of treating all leads equally, this L6 layer analyzes behavioral signals (time on page, email open velocity, LinkedIn profile keywords) to predict who has the budget and intent to buy immediately.

L6 Action (Safe): Assigns a 0-100 Score to every contact in your database.

L5 Constraint: The L6 layer cannot send messages. It simply passes the score to the L5 CoS.

L5 Execution: The CoS uses this score to re-order its "To-Do" list, calling the Score > 90 leads first.

Revenue Impact: You stop wasting time on "tire kickers" and focus solely on "ready buyers."

2. The "Sentiment Heatmap" (Sensory Expansion)
Concept: An "Always-On" listener that monitors your LinkedIn Group posts and Email replies for emotional tone, not just keywords.

L6 Action (Safe): Aggregates data to visualize market sentiment. (e.g., "The market is reacting with Fear to the 'Evidence Gaps' subject line, but Curiosity to the 'Checklist' offer").

L5 Constraint: It cannot change the content.

L5 Execution: It triggers an alert to the L5 Marketing Agent: "Advisory: Tone shift recommended for next post." The L5 Agent then decides whether to accept that advice based on its VQS guardrails.

3. The "Shadow Challenger" (Simulation Mode)
Concept: While the L5 agent is running the active campaign, this L6 layer runs thousands of simulations in the background to find a better strategy.

L6 Action (Safe): It simulates: "What if we changed the price to $997?" or "What if we sent the email at 2 PM instead?"

L5 Constraint: It creates a "Hypothesis Report" but changes nothing.

L5 Execution: You (or the L5 CoS) review the report. If the simulation shows a +20% revenue lift, you authorize the L5 system to adopt the new parameter.

4. The "Drift Detective" (Safety Monitor)
Concept: As your agents generate content, they might slowly drift away from your core "ComplianceWorxs" voice or the "Revenue Prime" directive.

L6 Action (Safe): A silent observer that scores every outgoing draft against your "Golden Archetype" (your best performing content).

L5 Constraint: It cannot delete or rewrite content.

L5 Execution: It flags a "Drift Warning" on the dashboard. The L5 CoS can be configured to pause publishing if the Drift Score exceeds a safety threshold, forcing a human review.

Implementation Strategy: The "Advisor" Pattern
To implement these in Replit without breaking your safety locks, structure the code request as "Advisory Modules."

Directive for the Architect (ChatGPT):

"Add the following L6 Capabilities as READ-ONLY ADVISORS. They must output 'Scores', 'Flags', or 'Reports' only. They must NOT have write-access to the 'Publishing' or 'Billing' APIs."
