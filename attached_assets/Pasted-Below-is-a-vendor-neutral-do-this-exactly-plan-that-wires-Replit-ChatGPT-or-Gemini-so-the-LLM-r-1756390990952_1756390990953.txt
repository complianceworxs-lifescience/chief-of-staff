Below is a vendor-neutral, do-this-exactly plan that wires Replit ↔ (ChatGPT or Gemini) so the LLM reads your dashboards + emails, synthesizes them, and dispatches directives to agents with zero HITL.

1) What runs every morning (overview)

Ingest the latest data:

a) Dashboards → export/emit JSON snapshots.

b) Emails → auto-forward or API-pull → parse → JSON.

Normalize into 5 files in /data:

scoreboard.json, initiatives.json, decisions.json, actions.json, meetings.json (optional: insights.json).

Validate (tiny shape checks).

LLM “Directive Engine” (ChatGPT or Gemini) → returns directives.json.

Dispatch one payload per agent to your webhooks.

Log lineage + (optional) send the CoS Snapshot email to the CEO.

You already have most of this (validators, orchestrator, snapshot). The only new piece is ingesting your emails + dashboards automatically.

2) Getting the data in (dashboards + emails)
A) Dashboards (cleanest path)

Have each dashboard write a JSON snapshot at the end of its run (or on a cron):

scoreboard.json – top 5 KPIs (revenue pace, health, alignment/autonomy, risk, GTM momentum).

initiatives.json – the RAG list with “path to green”.

decisions.json – things that need CEO approval.

actions.json – candidate “next best actions” from agent logs.

meetings.json – last meeting summary + actions.

(Optional) insights.json – notable lifts or anomalies.

If your dashboards already live in Replit, this is a one-liner json.dump() at the end of each job.

B) Emails (two practical options)

Option 1 — Zero-API forwarding (fastest):

Create a Gmail filter for your morning reports (subject contains “CEO Oversight”, “Content Digest”, etc.).

Forward matches to a Replit HTTPS endpoint like POST /inbound/email (use a relay such as Mailgun, Postmark inbound, or a tiny webhook proxy).

Parse the HTML → map fields → write to /data/*.json.

Option 2 — Gmail API (native pull):

Service account / OAuth; read label cw/daily-reports every morning at 06:30; parse latest threads; write JSON.

Either way, the parser’s job is to convert the email into the same fields your dashboards export so the LLM sees one consistent schema.

3) Exact files you keep in /data (minimal keys)
// scoreboard.json
{
  "date": "2025-08-28",
  "revenue": { "realized_week": 42000, "target_week": 48000, "upsells": 1200 },
  "initiatives": { "on_time_pct": 76, "risk_inverted": 72, "resource_ok_pct": 85, "dependency_clear_pct": 64 },
  "alignment": { "work_tied_to_objectives_pct": 86 },
  "autonomy": { "auto_resolve_pct": 91, "mttr_min": 4.3 },
  "risk": { "score": 78, "high": 2, "medium": 1, "next_deadline_hours": 4 },
  "narrative": { "topic": "OpenAI critique", "linkedin_er_delta_pct": 19, "email_ctr_delta_pct": 11, "quiz_to_paid_delta_pct": 2.4, "conversions": 3 }
}

// initiatives.json
[
  {
    "name": "Grow Validation Strategist Tier",
    "owner": "CRO",
    "health_score": 82,
    "rag": "green",
    "milestones": [{"title":"Case study live","due":"2025-08-30","status":"on_track"}],
    "risks": [{"text":"Ad creative fatigue","owner":"CMO","due":"2025-08-29"}],
    "path_to_green": ["Ship VS case study", "Double cadence on winning topic for 72h"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Reduce RL Churn",
    "owner": "COO",
    "health_score": 58,
    "rag": "amber",
    "milestones": [{"title":"Welcome revamp","due":"2025-09-02","status":"slipping"}],
    "risks": [{"text":"Onboarding email gaps","owner":"CMO","due":"2025-08-29"}],
    "path_to_green": ["Add 3-email activation series", "In-product checklist for first 72h"]
  }
]


The other three (decisions.json, actions.json, meetings.json) match the shapes I gave you earlier and your Directive Center already understands them.

4) Make Replit call ChatGPT or Gemini (vendor-neutral)

You already have orchestrator.py. Keep it and set:

LLM_PROVIDER=openai or LLM_PROVIDER=gemini

OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY

The orchestrator does:

load /data/*.json

run validators

call_llm() → returns directives.json

dispatch_directives() to agent webhooks

write /lineage/*

That’s your no-HITL loop.

5) Where autonomy fits (and why you still want this)

Your functional agents (CMO/CRO/Content/CCO/COO) are autonomous. But they’re autonomous within their lane. The CoS loop is the orchestrator:

Converts many signals (dashboards + emails) into one plan.

Ensures alignment to company KPIs (e.g., revenue pace ≥ 90% this week).

Resolves conflicts (budget vs compliance vs GTM priorities).

Enforces guardrails (approval, escalation, SLA).

Without it, agents drift: each optimizes locally; nobody owns the business composite.

So: yes—you need this loop. Think of it as the “boss process” your autonomous agents report to each morning.

6) Exactly what to hand to Replit (copy list)

Files:

/orchestrator.py (runner)

/cos_validators.py (you already have it)

/data/*.json (the five/six inputs)

/templates/snapshot.html (optional email)

Secrets:
LLM_PROVIDER, OPENAI_API_KEY/GEMINI_API_KEY, CW_SHARED_SECRET, RUN_AT=06:35, and one webhook per agent (CMO_WEBHOOK, CRO_WEBHOOK, CONTENT_WEBHOOK, CCO_WEBHOOK, COO_WEBHOOK, CEO_WEBHOOK).

Always-On: Deploy or keep the loop running (the script checks local time and fires once a day).

7) Ingesting your emails today (pick one)

Fastest (no API):

Set Gmail filter → Forward to inbound service → Replit POST /inbound/email

Parse HTML → map to fields → write /data/scoreboard.json & friends.
(I can give you a tiny Flask endpoint if you want to paste it.)

Native (API):

Gmail label cw/daily-reports → Replit job pulls the newest each morning → parse → write JSON.

Either way, once /data is refreshed, the rest is automatic.

8) Acceptance test (15 minutes)

Drop sample JSONs in /data.

Set MODE=once and Run.

Confirm:

Validators pass or show clear DATA GAPs.

A directives.json is produced.

Webhook catcher receives the per-agent POST.

/lineage/* has input + output snapshots.

(Optional) Snapshot email arrives.
