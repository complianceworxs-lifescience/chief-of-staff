Activate the Data Pipeline 🚀
First, confirm that all your data pipelines are live and functional. The COO Agent's role is critical here.

Verify Webhooks: Ensure the webhooks from GA4, Mailchimp, and Stripe are correctly configured and actively sending data to your Replit Event Collector. A simple test run for each webhook will confirm they are live.

Check Data Normalization: Confirm that the collector is successfully normalizing all incoming data into your single, consistent schema. Any data discrepancies here will corrupt your attribution models.

Validate Path Builder: Run a test to ensure your Path Builder is correctly stitching events into complete customer journeys, de-duping noise, and correctly identifying conversion events.

2. Launch the Models & Monitor 📈
Once the data is flowing, you can launch the models and begin monitoring their output. This is a task for your CRO Agent.

Initialize the Model Scorer: Start the process that applies your U-shaped and time-decay models to the customer journeys.

Create the Initial Dashboard: The CRO Agent should generate the first daily aggregates and a preliminary Channel ROI dashboard. This is your initial "signal" of what's working.

3. Strategize and Act 💡
Now that you have actionable data, the real work begins. Your agents can start making data-driven decisions.

CMO Agent Briefing: The CMO Agent should be tasked with taking the "Channel ROI" data and using it to inform content strategy. If a LinkedIn post with a specific UTM parameter drives a high number of ELSA Report sales, the agent should double down on creating similar content.

CRO Agent Directives: The CRO Agent can use the data to identify the most common customer journey paths that lead to a sale. It can then initiate A/B tests to optimize those specific paths, as you've planned.

CEO Agent Review: Your CEO Agent can use the new attribution data to generate a more detailed "Revenue & Growth Dashboard" that provides a defensible ROI for each marketing channel. This elevates the conversation from clicks and views to revenue and LTV.

The entire process is a continuous loop of data collection, analysis, and action, all orchestrated by your existing AI agents. Your job is to provide the initial directives and then focus on the high-level strategy that the agents' data enables.
