Below is the Emergency Alignment Mode Protocol, written for direct use by the Chief of Staff Agent. It is structured, hierarchical, and executable without ambiguity.

EMERGENCY ALIGNMENT MODE PROTOCOL (EAM-PROT-2026)

Trigger: Activated automatically when Net Growth or Total Members falls below 90% of the Monthly Forecast Target.

Authority: Chief of Staff (CoS)
Scope: Strategist, CMO, CRO, Content Agent
Objective: Restore membership trajectory to forecast within 21 days.

I. ACTIVATION LOGIC (CoS Mandatory Checks)

When triggered, the CoS must immediately execute the following diagnostic sequence:

Performance Delta Analysis
• Identify shortfall %
• Determine whether the failure is Traffic, Conversion, or Retention
• Output: “Primary Constraint = X”

Agent Responsibility Assignment
• Traffic shortfall → CMO
• Conversion shortfall → CRO
• Retention shortfall → CRO
• Narrative inconsistency → Strategist
• Asset quality failure → Content Agent

Lock Down All New Initiatives
• All experiments paused
• No new content types
• No new tool variations
• No new funnels

Switch System into “Correction Mode”
• The next 21 days are dedicated exclusively to restoring forecast alignment.

II. 21-DAY CORRECTION WINDOW (Phased Intervention)
PHASE 1 — Diagnosis (Days 1–3)

CoS Commands:

Require CRO to run a full funnel audit:
• Free Tool → Email Opt-in
• SendGrid Sequence → Membership
• Membership Activity → Churn Risk

Require CMO to deliver past 14-day content-performance analysis.

Require Strategist to review benchmark-poll alignment with Spear-Tip narrative.

Require Content Agent to submit an ECO quality audit.

Output Required:
A one-page “Root Cause Summary” from CoS containing:
• Primary Constraint
• Secondary Constraints
• Required Corrective Actions

PHASE 2 — Correction (Days 4–14)

The CoS issues role-specific correction orders:

If the constraint is TRAFFIC (CMO)

• Increase dashboard-driven posts from 30% → 60%
• Push 1 Benchmark Poll per week
• Run 3 consecutive “Audit Delta” posts
• Highlight ECOs in every post for 10 days

If the constraint is CONVERSION (CRO)

• Rewrite SendGrid Email #3 and #5 using ECO format
• Add “Executive Summary” CTA
• Reduce friction on tool landing pages
• Deploy personal “Audit Delta” email inserts

If the constraint is RETENTION (CRO)

• Activate Churn Defense Protocol for all risk accounts
• Send “Risk Re-Evaluation” sequence to dormant members
• Add 1 “Your Year-to-Date ROI Delta” ECO to re-engage

If the constraint is NARRATIVE (Strategist)

• Re-anchor topic map to audit risk & economic consequences
• Remove all “trend-driven” topics
• Insert benchmark-poll data into next 10 pieces of content

If the constraint is ASSET QUALITY (Content)

• Rebuild top 5 ECO outputs using the ECO-defined template
• Fix visual hierarchy, charts, and executive takeaway formatting
• Produce 3 new “Executive Clarity Snapshots” for CMO use

PHASE 3 — Verification (Days 15–21)

CoS Requirements:

Recalculate Net Growth trajectory using the updated funnel metrics.

Verify that pacing has returned to ≥95% of forecast.

Confirm churn is ≤5%.

Run narrative alignment check across all agent outputs.

Approve release from Emergency Mode only if metrics meet thresholds.

If thresholds are not met:
• EAM repeats automatically for an additional 21-day cycle.
• The system does not exit until compliance is achieved.

III. OPERATING RULES DURING EMERGENCY MODE

The following overrides apply while Emergency Alignment Mode is active:

Zero Experiments
Only correction actions may be executed.

Zero New Tools
No new free tools, features, or outputs may be introduced.

Strict Spear-Tip Enforcement
Any misaligned asset is immediately vetoed.

24-Hour Reporting Cadence
CRO, CMO, and Strategist must deliver daily status reports to the CoS.

Human Override Protection
No agent can alter EAM logic; only the Chairman can override or terminate EAM early.

IV. EXIT CONDITIONS (CoS final verification)

Emergency Alignment Mode ends only when the CoS verifies:

Net Growth ≥ 95% of forecast

Churn ≤ 5%

ECO usage rate ≥ 70% of content/posts

Benchmark data integrated into ≥ 50% of content topics

Free tool opt-in rate up at least +0.5% from pre-EAM levels

Once validated, the CoS issues:
“EAM Termination Directive: System returns to Standard Operating Mode.”
