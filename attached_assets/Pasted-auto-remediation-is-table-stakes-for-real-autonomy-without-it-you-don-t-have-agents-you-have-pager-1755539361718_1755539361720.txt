auto-remediation is table-stakes for real autonomy—without it, you don’t have agents; you have pagers. It’s the difference between noticing a problem and fixing it before you’re pulled in.

Here’s the full picture of what matters for Agent Autonomy (ranked by impact):

Tier 1 — Must-haves (make autonomy real)

Auto-remediation (self-healing)

Detect → classify → pick playbook → execute → verify → log → escalate.

Covers conflicts, capacity, transient errors, missing data, and config drift.

Clear priorities & arbitration

Deterministic tie-breakers across agents (e.g., Revenue > Marketing > Content).

Preemption rules: who yields when resources collide.

Observability & SLOs

Health signals: success rate, backlog age, alignment score, time-to-recover.

SLOs per agent (e.g., “95% directives within 30m”) that trigger remediation.

Safety guardrails

Allowed actions/policies, budget caps, scope limits, data access boundaries.

Built-in rollback/undo for risky operations.

Decision lineage & explainability

Every auto-fix recorded with: problem → playbook → result → metric delta.

Enables audits and model improvement.

Tier 2 — Performance multipliers

Cost awareness

Actions priced against a budget; prefer cheaper playbooks when equivalent.

Pause noncritical work when burn rate spikes.

Resource orchestration

Dynamic scaling/slots per agent; reallocate compute/queue depth on demand.

Data dependency management

Input contracts, freshness checks, cache refresh strategies, fallback sources.

Learning loop

Post-fix review: promote successful playbooks, demote noisy ones.

Gradient: conflicts resolved faster over time with fewer escalations.

Human-in-the-Loop thresholds

Only escalate when: attempts exhausted, high-risk action, or KPI damage projected.

CEO/COO override surfaces top 2 recommended fixes, not raw logs.

Tier 3 — Resilience & evolution

Versioning & change management

Canary new playbooks; feature flags; staged rollouts.

Simulation/chaos tests

Nightly conflict drills and failure injection; verify auto-recovery works.

Policy compliance

Map actions to compliance constraints (GxP, audit trails, PII handling).

Minimal checklist for ComplianceWorxs (practical)

✅ Auto-remediation router with 5 classifiers: CONFLICT, TRANSIENT, CAPACITY, DATA_DEP, CONFIG.

✅ Priority table: ["Revenue","Marketing","Content"] used by conflict resolver.

✅ SLOs per agent: success ≥ 94%, alignment ≥ 95%, backlog age ≤ 15m.

✅ Budget caps per agent + per directive; stop or throttle on breach.

✅ Lineage log per action with before/after metrics.

✅ Escalation rule: max 2 failed fixes → escalate to CEO with two safe options.

KPIs to prove autonomy (track weekly)

MTTD (detect) and MTTR (recover) per agent.

% auto-resolved vs escalated (aim >85% auto).

Conflict half-life (time from detection → cleared).

Cost per resolved incident (should trend down).

Alignment drift rate (how often playbooks need manual override).

If you only do three things this week

Turn on auto-remediation with 2 attempts + escalation.

Enforce a global priority policy for arbitration.

Wire SLO triggers that launch playbooks and write lineage.

Do that, and your Chief of Staff stops paging you and starts running the shop.
