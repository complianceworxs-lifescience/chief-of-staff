Subject: Are we still validating like it’s 2015?
Preview: 5 evidence gaps auditors are flagging in Q4.

Hi *|FNAME|*,

I’m seeing a major shift across the validation teams I work with in pharma and medtech.

Many are quietly moving away from “Traditional CSV” — the manual screenshots, static Word docs, and retroactive traceability matrices.

Here’s why the shift is happening:

• You cannot validate modern systems (AI/ML, dynamic cloud apps) at human speed.  
• Documentation review is now consuming 60% of the total validation budget.  
• Auditors have started challenging static evidence as “insufficient” for dynamic systems.  
• Even well-run CSV teams are missing key evidence artifacts that regulators now expect.

If we continue validating the way we did in 2015, we’re essentially documenting the past while technology moves ahead of us.

To help teams adapt, I put together an “Audit Readiness Checklist” based on the 5 evidence gaps auditors have been flagging most in Q4.

Before I send you anything else this week, let me ask:

**Are you still capturing evidence manually, or are you exploring automated approaches?**

Just hit reply and I’ll share a few examples of what I’m seeing across the industry.

Best,
