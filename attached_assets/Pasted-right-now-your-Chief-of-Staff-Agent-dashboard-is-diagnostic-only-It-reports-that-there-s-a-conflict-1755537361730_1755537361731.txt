right now your Chief of Staff Agent dashboard is diagnostic only. It reports that there’s a conflict (CRO vs CMO vs Content Agent) but doesn’t give you a way to resolve it inside the same interface.

Here are concrete dashboard changes that would make it actionable instead of just informative:

1. Add Resolution Controls Next to Predictions

Conflict Assignment Button → “Assign to CEO Agent” / “Escalate to COO Agent” / “Auto-Resolve”

One-Click Actions for the suggested fixes:

[Run Workflow Review]

[Reallocate Resources]

[Implement Priority Rules]

This way, you don’t just see what’s wrong — you can trigger remediation.

2. Interactive Root-Cause Drilldown

Click on “CRO vs CMO vs Content Agent” → expands a panel showing:

Which tasks are blocked

Which dependencies are overlapping

Which agent outputs are delayed

Provide a visual dependency graph so you can see which agent is the real bottleneck.

3. Priority Rule Engine (Inside Dashboard)

Add a dropdown or slider that lets you set conflict resolution rules in real time:

Example: “Revenue > Marketing > Content”

Or weight by % priority (Revenue 50%, Marketing 30%, Content 20%).
The system applies the hierarchy automatically when conflicts occur.

4. Conflict Playbook Integration

Instead of static “Suggested Actions,” make them click-to-execute templates:

“Run Comprehensive Workflow Review” = triggers COO Agent to perform it.

“Reallocate Resources” = CRO Agent redistributes compute/credits.

“Implement Priority Task Management” = Content Agent reprioritizes backlog.

5. Escalation + Feedback Loop

If a conflict can’t be resolved automatically, a button should appear:

[Escalate to CEO Agent for Strategic Override]

Once resolved, a feedback note is stored so the system learns which fix worked best for future conflicts.

✅ Net Result: The dashboard transforms from a report card into a command center. You get predictive analytics plus real-time remediation controls.

Do you want me to sketch a wireframe mockup of how the upgraded dashboard would look (with buttons, drilldowns, and priority sliders) so you can hand it straight to Replit?
