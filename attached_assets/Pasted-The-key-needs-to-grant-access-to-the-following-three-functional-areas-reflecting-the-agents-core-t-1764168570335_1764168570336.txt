The key needs to grant access to the following three functional areas, reflecting the agents' core tasks:1. Unified Data Layer & Analytics (Librarian/Strategist)The system needs to centralize, analyze, and report on performance data, which resides primarily in Google's ecosystem.Required Functionality: Read/Write access to Sheets, Drive, and BigQuery.Why it's needed: The Librarian Agent must be able to:Ingest logs, VQS data, and objection reports from the agents (stored in a central Sheets or Drive log).Manage the Unified Data Layer schema.The Strategist Agent needs access to this consolidated data for running simulations and adversarial checks.2. Marketing & Revenue Automation (CMO/CRO)The agents must execute the Walker Dark Social Blueprint and the Kern Conversion Sequence, which involve campaign tracking and outreach.Required Functionality: Access to track engagement and potentially trigger actions through Google Analytics or other related marketing data sources, which feed directly into your third-party SaaS tools (like Mailchimp).Why it's needed: The CMO Agent uses engagement data to refine the Signal $\rightarrow$ Proof $\rightarrow$ Insight Loop. The CRO Agent needs confirmation of campaign delivery and link clicks to initiate the Kern sequence.3. Business Systems & Communication (CoS/Content Manager)The agents must manage internal documents and produce audit-grade evidence and reports.Required Functionality: Read/Write access to Google Docs/Sheets/Slides (for document generation) and Google Calendar (for scheduling agent cycles/sprints).Why it's needed: The Content Manager Agent produces the IT/QA/Finance Stakeholder Packets (audit-grade documents) and the monthly Intelligence Reports. The CoS Agent often uses Calendar to enforce weekly and quarterly sprint deadlines.Technical ActionYou do not need to integrate every single Google API, but you must ensure the Service Account Key is granted the necessary IAM (Identity and Access Management) Roles or Scopes within the Google Cloud Project that provide Editor or appropriate Contributor permissions to access the specific resources (Drive, Sheets, Analytics) that host the ComplianceWorxs operational data.
