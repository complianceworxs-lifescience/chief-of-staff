UI Improvements

Conflict Banner Section

Add a small inline banner above the directive card that only appears if there’s a conflict.

Example:

⚠ Conflict Detected: CRO Agent vs CMO Agent
Resolution: Prioritized CRO (Revenue Impact Higher)


Resolution Log

Each directive card should show a “Last Conflict” row at the bottom:

Short description of the conflict

Short description of how it was resolved

Timestamp

Example:

Last Conflict (2h ago): CMO wanted brand-first messaging, CRO prioritized revenue-first.  
Resolution: CRO priority applied, logged in system.


One-Click Intercede Button

Add a single “Intercede” button (replace Reassign/Cancel for conflicts).

If pressed, it pauses agent execution and pulls the directive into your queue for manual review.

🔹 Agent Actions for Conflict Resolution

When a conflict arises (e.g., two agents disagree on execution path):

Auto-Detect Conflict

Agents tag a directive with status: conflict.

Log which agents are in disagreement and the issue.

Auto-Resolve Rules

Use weighted governance rules (e.g. revenue > marketing > ops > admin).

Apply the rule, continue execution, and log resolution.

Write Conflict Summary

Agents generate a 1–2 line summary:

“Conflict: CMO wanted 2-week brand campaign, CRO needed 1-week sales sprint.
Resolution: CRO priority applied due to revenue urgency.”

Push to Dashboard

Resolution summary appears directly in the directive card.

Conflict count (e.g. “3 conflicts auto-resolved this week”) can show at the top of the dashboard.

Escalation Threshold

If auto-resolve fails (e.g. both sides equal weight, or repeated conflicts), system triggers the Intercede button for you.

🔹 Example Dashboard Card After Improvement
Partnership Playbook Leadership
-------------------------------------------------
Status: ACTIVE | Priority: HIGH | CRO Agent
Goal: $30K MRR, 5 enterprise clients
Impact: 95/100 | Effort: 75/100

Last Conflict (4h ago): CCO wanted audit-first, CRO pushed for revenue-first.
Resolution: CRO priority applied per governance rule.
-------------------------------------------------
[Pause] [Escalate] [Intercede]


👉 This keeps the UI actionable and glanceable:

Agents resolve conflicts themselves and leave a short log.

You only see a short description + resolution.

You step in only if the Intercede button lights up.
