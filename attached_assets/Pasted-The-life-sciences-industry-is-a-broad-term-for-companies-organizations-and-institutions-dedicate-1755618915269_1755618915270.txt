The "life sciences" industry is a broad term for companies, organizations, and institutions dedicated to researching, developing, and manufacturing products that improve the lives of humans and animals.

At its core, the industry is comprised of three main pillars:

Pharmaceuticals: These are companies that discover, develop, produce, and market drugs or pharmaceutical drugs for use as medications to be administered to patients to cure them, vaccinate them, or alleviate symptoms. (e.g., Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson).

Biotechnology (Biotech): This sector uses living organisms or their derivatives to develop products. While there's overlap with pharma, biotech often focuses on large-molecule drugs (biologics), gene therapies, and other advanced treatments derived from biological processes. (e.g., Amgen, Genentech, Moderna).

Medical Devices: This includes a wide range of products, from simple tongue depressors and medical gloves to complex programmable pacemakers and advanced imaging systems. It covers anything used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease that isn't a drug. (e.g., Medtronic, Siemens Healthineers, Boston Scientific).

Beyond these three core pillars, the life sciences ecosystem also includes several crucial supporting industries that your business targets:

Diagnostics: Companies focused on developing tests and tools to detect diseases and medical conditions.

Contract Research Organizations (CROs): Companies that provide support to the pharma, biotech, and medical device industries in the form of outsourced research services (e.g., running clinical trials).

Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs): Companies that provide outsourced manufacturing services for the industries above.

Life Science Software & IT: Companies like yours that provide specialized software and technology solutions for data management, quality control, and compliance.

All of these sectors are bound by a common thread: strict regulatory oversight from bodies like the FDA and EMA, which is precisely why compliance is such a critical function across the entire industry.
