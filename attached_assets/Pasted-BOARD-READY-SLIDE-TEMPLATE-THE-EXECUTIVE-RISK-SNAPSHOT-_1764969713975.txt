BOARD-READY SLIDE TEMPLATE: "THE EXECUTIVE RISK SNAPSHOT"Purpose: Transform the Free Tool output from a "quiz result" into a piece of critical business infrastructure.User Psychology: "I can copy-paste this directly into my Monthly Management Review (MMR) deck to justify budget/resources."I. VISUAL WIREFRAME (16:9 Aspect Ratio)Header:Title: GxP Audit Risk & Economic Impact AssessmentDate: [Current Date] | Scope: [User’s Dept/Area]Status: [CRITICAL / AT RISK / CONTROLLED] (Color-coded Red/Yellow/Green)Zone A: The "Audit Delta" (Left Column - 30% Width)Visual: A Speedometer or simple Bar Chart.Metric: Compliance Readiness Score: [X]/100Gap Analysis:Current Velocity: [Slow/Manual]Audit Ready: [No]Data Integrity Risk: [High/Med/Low]Zone B: The "Economic Consequence" (Center - 40% Width)Visual: "Cost of Inaction" Table (The Spear-Tip).Key Data Points (Dynamic Variables):Est. Validation Lag: [X] Weeks per year.Resource Waste: [X] Hours/Month on manual review.Projected Revenue Risk: $[X,XXX] per day of audit delay.Narrative: "Current manual processes create a [X]% efficiency drag on release cycles."Zone C: The "Agent Remediation" (Right Column - 30% Width)Visual: The "Green Path" (Future State).Projection:With AI Agents: Audit Readiness $\uparrow$ [X]%.Time Savings: [X] Hours returned to Quality Ops.ROI Timeline: Positive within [X] Days.Call to Action (Subtle): "Remediation Model: ComplianceWorxs L5.5 Agent Architecture."Footer:Confidential Internal Assessment | Generated by ComplianceWorxs MethodologyII. DYNAMIC VARIABLES (The Logic)To generate this slide, the Free Tool must calculate three specific numbers based on the user's quiz answers:The Drag Metric: Convert "Hours spent on documentation" $\to$ "Annual Cost of Waste" (Avg Hourly Rate x Hours).The Risk Factor: Convert "Last Audit Result" + "Current Staffing" $\to$ "Audit Probability Score."The Solution Delta: Calculate the difference between Current Manual Cost vs. Membership Cost ($X/mo) = Immediate ROI.III. THE CONVERSION HOOKWhy this drives the 4.0% Conversion Target:The user is not buying a membership; they are buying the solution to the red numbers in Zone B.The Slide is the Problem: It validates their pain.The Membership is the Solution: The "Remediation Path" in Zone C explicitly names the ComplianceWorxs Membership as the fix.Next StepThe system is now fully defined: Schedule, Directive, Emergency Protocol, and Asset Template.
