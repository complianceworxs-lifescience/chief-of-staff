COMPLIANCEWORXS — L6 TRANSITION PACKAGE (A–D, Unified Directive)

Version: L6-Transition-v1.0
Purpose: Enable controlled L6 experimentation WITHOUT destabilizing the L5 system.
Governing Agents: Strategist (primary), CoS (enforcement), CRO, CMO, Content Manager.

A) L6 SANDBOX DIRECTIVE (Enable L6 Safely)

The Strategist Agent must activate an L6 Strategic Sandbox, a fully isolated experimental environment that allows L6 behaviors without impacting L5 operations.

A1. Sandbox Boundaries

All L6 ideas/actions must remain in Sandbox until approved.
Sandbox includes:

New narratives

New pricing models

New product ideas

Category reframes

Methodology enhancements

Offer ladder re-architecture

Market expansion hypotheses

A2. Sandbox Requirements

The Sandbox MUST:

Log all outputs into a segregated UDL partition (“L6_Sandbox”).

Never overwrite L5 models (VQS, Offer Ladder, RPM, Packets).

Never publish content to main audience.

Never trigger the CRO Ladder automatically.

Never modify Strategist RPM weights outside Sandbox.

A3. Activation Conditions

The Strategist may activate the Sandbox only if:

RPM accuracy ≥ 85% (current threshold).

No unresolved drift indicators exist.

B) L6 CoS GOVERNANCE ADDENDUM (Control Layer Upgrade)

The CoS becomes the L6 Gatekeeper, ensuring all L6 experiments remain safe, isolated, and reversible.

B1. CoS Approval for L6 Promotion

The CoS must approve any movement from Sandbox → Live System based on:

VQS Methodology Lock requirements

Micro-Cohort Testing results

RPM stability

Trust signal impact

No increase in friction from stakeholder packets

B2. L6 Experiment Budget Cap

The CoS must enforce:

Token usage cap per L6 experiment

Maximum experiment duration (7 days)

Maximum number of simultaneous experiments (3)

B3. L6 Failure Rollback Protocol

If an L6 experiment produces one or more of the following:

Trust signal decline

Rising skepticism

Conversion drop

Confusion in objections

VQS boundary risk
The CoS must rollback the experiment and flag Strategist for root-cause analysis.

B4. L6 Reporting

The CoS must maintain a log of:

Proposed experiments

Active experiments

Completed experiments

Abandoned experiments

Graduated experiments (promoted into L5)

C) L5 → L6 TRANSITION MAP (Textual Blueprint for Replit)

The following is the Replit-ingestible map showing how L6 overlays on L5:

C1. L5 Baseline (Current State)

Agents optimize within fixed frameworks

VQS immutable

Offer Ladder fixed and validated

Dunford/Walker/Kern stable

RPM predictions reliable and constrained

Content Archetypes A–H operational

2-hour ODAR health cycle active

No agent may redesign the system

C2. L6 Overlay (Future State)

Agents can propose:

new product lines

new markets

new pricing

new category narratives

methodology enhancements

new conversion architectures

new content archetype families

structural business model innovations

C3. Controlled Integration Rules

All proposals → Sandbox

All experiments → 5% micro-cohort

All methodology changes → VQS Methodology Lock

All experiments → capped tokens

All experiments → reversible

All outputs logged separately

No experiment overrides L5 core without CoS authorization

C4. Graduation Criteria

Sandbox output can graduate to L5 only if:

Micro-cohort signals strong

No trust erosion

RPM remains stable

No friction spikes in stakeholder packets

Strategist simulations confirm viability

CoS signs off

Architect approval optional (not required)

D) FULL INTEGRATION PACKAGE (Embedding A–C into Operating Context)

This section updates the Operating Context to formally include L6 transition controls.

D1. Add to Section: Governance Rules

“Two L6 Transition Protocols are now permanent:

Methodology Lock (VQS Protection)

Micro-Cohort Testing (5% audience cap)”

D2. Add to Section: Strategist Responsibilities

Strategist must:

Maintain L6 Sandbox

Run simulations for all L6 ideas

Prove all methodology changes safer and more conservative

Validate experiments using regulatory data

D3. Add to Section: CoS Responsibilities

CoS must:

Enforce Sandbox isolation

Govern experiment lifecycle

Enforce experiment caps

Approve/deny L6 → L5 transitions

Trigger rollback on drift/skepticism

Protect L5 revenue pathways

D4. Add to Section: CRO Responsibilities

CRO must:

Run L6 experiments only on micro-cohorts

Track conversion patterns

Report friction to CoS

Never replace L5 Offer Ladder without graduation process

D5. Add to Section: CMO Responsibilities

CMO must:

Assign experimental Archetypes only to cohort segments

Ensure experimental content carries “research-phase” metadata

Analyze trust signals during tests

D6. Add to Section: Content Manager Responsibilities
