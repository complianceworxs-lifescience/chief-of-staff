The current form makes it too easy to send vague, one-off instructions. A CoS-quality directive needs structure, alignment to business goals, and guardrails. Here’s a punch-list you can implement without bloating the UI.

What to add (minimal but powerful)
1) Structure the directive

Directive type (radio): Implementation • Operational • Decision • Daily Run • Experiment
Why: routes to the right agent workflow and determines required fields.

Link to Objective/Initiative (dropdown + “+ New”): ties every directive to a company priority.

KPI impact (multi-select chips): Revenue Pace, Strategic Health, Alignment, Risk Radar, GTM Momentum.
Optional numeric target inputs per KPI (e.g., % to 90 by Fri).

2) Make responsibility explicit

Target Agents: allow multi-select + Watchers/CC (e.g., CoS & CEO).

Escalation clock: “Escalate after __ hours” (default 72h).

Requires CEO approval (toggle): inserts an approval step & blocks dispatch until approved.

3) Turn “content” into an executable plan

Replace the big free-text box with three small sections (still keep a tiny notes box):

Title (one line)

Rationale (why this matters—ties to KPIs/insights)

Tasks (repeatable rows): Task • Owner (hint) • Due date • Link (+Add row)

Success criteria / Targets (repeatable rows): KPI • Goal • By date

4) Reduce friction with templates & autofill

Template picker (pill buttons above the form):

72-hour GTM sprint

Fast-track content brief

Close High compliance risk

Budget shift + experiment

Autofill from context (tiny links under each field):

“Insert top Insight” → prefill rationale

“Insert Decision” → prefill title/options/due

“Insert Meeting Actions” → convert into task rows

5) Preview, validate, and schedule

Preview JSON (side drawer): shows the directive payload that will be sent to the agent webhook.

Validate (inline): highlights missing fields; blocks send on critical gaps.

Schedule: One-off now / date-time / recurring (e.g., daily 06:35 for “Daily Run”).

6) Confirmation & follow-through

Send test (to self/CoS)

Dispatch (primary button) + Show recipients (agent webhooks)

Post-send tracker (tiny banner): “Ack received ✓ • SLA 72h • Escalates: Tue 10:00”.

Suggested layout (one screen, no clutter)

Top row:
Target Agents (multi) • Priority • Deadline (date+time) • Requires CEO approval (toggle)

Section: Strategy
Directive Type • Objective/Initiative • KPI Impact (+ targets)

Section: Plan
Title • Rationale • Tasks table (Add row) • Success criteria table (Add row) • Attachments/Links

Footer:
Escalation after __ hours • Schedule (Now/Datetime/Recurring)
Buttons: Preview JSON • Send Test • Dispatch

Microcopy you can drop in

Directive Type help text: “Determines required fields and routing (e.g., ‘Daily Run’ adds schedule & recurrence).”

KPI Impact help text: “Pick the business KPI(s) this directive will move. Add numeric target(s) if applicable.”

Escalation help text: “If not completed or acknowledged within this window, CoS will auto-escalate.”

Example (pre-filled) using your current strategy

Directive Type: Operational
Objective: Grow Validation Strategist Tier
KPI Impact: Revenue Pace → Goal: 90% By: Fri
Target Agents: CMO, Content (Watchers: CRO, CoS)
Priority: High
Deadline: 72h
Escalation: 72h
Requires CEO approval: Off

Title: 72-hour VS GTM sprint (OpenAI-critique theme)
Rationale: +19% ER on this theme; 3 paid yesterday; short sprint can close this week’s revenue gap.
Tasks:

Produce 2 new creatives + repurpose top clip — Owner hint: CMO — Due: 08/30 — Link: (campaign brief)

UTM tag all assets utm_campaign=openai_crit_72h — Owner hint: CMO — Due: 08/29

Publish VS case study with pricing CTA — Owner hint: Content — Due: 08/30 — Link: (doc)
Success criteria / Targets:

Revenue Pace → 90% by Fri

Content-attributed paid conversions → ≥3 by Sun

Why these changes matter

Consistency: Every directive links to an objective and KPI; agents know the “why,” not just the “what.”

Executability: Tasks, owners, due dates, and links turn directives into work—no guesswork.

Governance: Approval toggle, escalation clock, and JSON preview prevent silent failure.

Speed: Templates + autofill let you issue high-quality directives in <60 seconds.
