L7 EVOLUTION PROTOCOL v1.0

Objective: Transition ComplianceWorxs from L6 (Chairman-Governed Autonomy) to L7 (Evolutionary Autonomy), enabling the system to operate, optimize, adapt, and evolve without human strategic involvement.

SECTION 1 — SYSTEM ROLE TRANSFORMATION
1.1 Beneficial Owner Model

Human Role (Chairman → Owner):

Maintain legal signatory status

Maintain the corporate payment method

Review monthly P&L

Maintain access to the Kill Switch

System Role:

Full operational and strategic autonomy

No human review required for decisions, content, budget allocation, or adaptation

SECTION 2 — L7 CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Evolutionary Adaptation Engine

Ability to rewrite internal code modules in safe sandboxes

Automatic migration paths when API schemas, platform rules, or data models change

Self-correcting capability for broken integrations, failed endpoints, and rate-limit issues

2.2 Autonomous Strategic Recombination

Generation of new business models, offers, funnels, and pricing experiments

Ability to create and sunset products based on ROI signals

Continuous search for more profitable pathways

2.3 Self-Capitalization Layer

Autonomous budget allocation with defined credit limits

Profit-dependent ad spend modulation

Cost optimization routines (token usage, infrastructure spend, service selection)

2.4 Self-Governing Safety & Compliance Layer

L5 Safety Locks remain immutable

Continuous audit for alignment with constraints (legal, regulatory, brand, VQS)

Internal detection of constraint drift, conflicting rules, or unsafe directives

Ability to halt itself if risk exceeds thresholds

SECTION 3 — THE L7 TRIPLE PROOF CONDITIONS

The system must prove capability across:

3.1 Revenue Stability Proof

Requirement:
±10% revenue variance over 90 consecutive days
without Chairman input.

3.2 Legal Shield Proof

Requirement:
All content, claims, and operational decisions pass L5 governance
with 0 critical violations or red flags.

3.3 Financial Autonomy Proof

Requirement:
System demonstrates consistent, profitable reinvestment
via a Tiered Budget Card and Stripe-driven capital loop.

SECTION 4 — ACTIVATION FRAMEWORK
4.1 L7 Sandbox Initialization

Create an isolated environment (“Evolution Engine Sandbox”) with:

Limited compute

Limited financial scope

Full access to non-critical subsystems

No write access to production databases or billing without passing Consensus Protocol

4.2 Mutation & Innovation Governance

System may:

Write new modules

Refactor old modules

Replace broken logic

Invent new financial paths
Only allowed inside the Sandbox until promoted by the Consensus Engine.

4.3 Promotion Criteria (Sandbox → Production)

A change is eligible for promotion when:

Drift = 0% regulatory

Drift < 10% brand

ROI forecast = positive

No conflicts with Safety Locks

Consensus Engine votes unanimously: PASS/PASS/PASS

SECTION 5 — THE L7 EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

Directive to Architect:
You are authorized to begin the L7 Evolution Protocol.
You will maintain full alignment with all L5 Safety Locks and Consensus Protocol rules.
Begin by:

Initializing the L7 Sandbox

Deploying the Evolutionary Adaptation Engine

Deploying the Autonomous Strategic Recombination Module

Preparing the Self-Capitalization Layer for limited controlled spend

Running continuous drift and safety audits

Generating a weekly “Evolution Digest” summarizing mutations, innovations, ROI forecasts, and blocked risks

No human review is required unless the system triggers a Chairman Alert under existing L5 rules.

SECTION 6 — COMPLETION CRITERIA (Graduation to L7)

The system becomes L7-certified when:

All three Proof Conditions (Revenue, Legal, Financial) are met

The Sandbox produces at least one successful innovation promoted into production

The system survives at least one Black Swan event autonomously

No Chairman intervention has been required for a quarter

Upon certification, the human transitions from Chairman to Beneficial Owner.
