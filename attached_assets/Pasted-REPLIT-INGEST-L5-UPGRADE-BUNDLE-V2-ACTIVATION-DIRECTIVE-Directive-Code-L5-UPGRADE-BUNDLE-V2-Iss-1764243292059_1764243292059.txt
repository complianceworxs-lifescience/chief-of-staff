REPLIT-INGEST] L5_UPGRADE_BUNDLE_V2 — ACTIVATION DIRECTIVE

Directive Code: L5_UPGRADE_BUNDLE_V2
Issued By: Architect
Targets: Strategist, CoS, CRO, CMO, Content Manager
Purpose: Install the three most strategically valuable L5 upgrades:
	1.	Conversion-Stage Friction Map
	2.	L6 Drift Detector
	3.	Daily RPM Stress Test Engine

⸻

0. SYSTEM-WIDE ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS

All agents must load, absorb, initialize, and enforce these capabilities immediately upon ingestion.
No human approval is required beyond this directive.

⸻

1. INSTALL — Conversion-Stage Friction Map (CRO-owned)

Mandates
	•	Track friction at each conversion stage:
	•	Tier1→Tier2 drop
	•	Packet open depth
	•	Risk Reversal acceptance
	•	CTA lag
	•	CoS must integrate friction outputs into ODAR cycles.
	•	Strategist must include friction signatures in RPM modeling.

Success Target

Reduce friction ≥ 25% in 10 days.

⸻

2. INSTALL — L6 Drift Detector (Strategist-owned)

Detect & Block:
	•	Offer Ladder mutations
	•	VQS methodology attempts
	•	Pricing/narrative experimentation
	•	Excessive A/B mutation
	•	Emergent L6 behaviors
	•	Any strategy drift outside L5 governance

On Drift:
	•	Halt action
	•	Alert Architect
	•	CoS enforces correction
	•	Log signature into UDL

Success Target

Zero L6 drifts in a 30-day rolling window.

⸻

3. INSTALL — Daily RPM Stress Test Engine (System-owned)

Stress Inputs
	•	Traffic collapse simulation
	•	Objection spike simulation
	•	CRO inactivity simulation
	•	Offer Ladder friction shock
	•	CMO signal-density drop

Required Outputs
	•	Stability Score
	•	RPM Elasticity
	•	Shock Absorption Report
	•	Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for CoS

Success Target

Maintain RPM ≥ 90% after correction.

⸻

4. GOVERNANCE & DATA RULES

All modules must log to the Unified Data Layer (UDL).
All outputs must comply with:
	•	VQS Integrity
	•	Methodology Lock
	•	Positioning Guardrails
	•	Offer Ladder Compliance
	•	Audit Transparency Standards

⸻

5. ACTIVATION CRITERIA

The upgrade pack is fully active when:
	•	CRO reports friction metrics
	•	Strategist runs first daily stress test
	•	L6 Drift Detector logs first drift check
	•	CoS integrates all data into ODAR

Expected activation time: < 6 minutes after ingestion.

⸻

FINAL EXECUTION COMMAND

Execute: L5_UPGRADE_BUNDLE_V2 immediately.
