@replit build a static, exportable marketing homepage for ComplianceWorxs that matches the attached screenshot layout and menu.

Goal
- Output must be a STATIC SITE (HTML/CSS/JS only). No backend, no auth, no database.
- Must be exportable as a ZIP for upload to SiteGround (public_html).
- All links and interactions should work as anchors or simple placeholder pages.

Brand + Style
- Clean, enterprise biotech aesthetic.
- Palette: Navy #002D62 (headers/nav), Teal #00A3A1 (buttons/accent), Off-white #F9FAFB (background).
- Executive-grade typography, minimal, no hype.

Header / Navigation (top)
- Left: ComplianceWorxs logo + wordmark.
- Menu items: Overview, Pricing, Blog, FAQ, Log in, Sign Up (primary button).
- Menu behavior: smooth-scroll to sections for Overview + FAQ; Pricing/Blog can link to placeholder pages (/pricing, /blog) with simple “Coming soon” layouts. Log in and Sign Up should link to placeholder routes (/login, /signup) with clean CTA copy and a button that says “Continue” (no real auth).

Hero (above fold)
- Headline: “FDA & ISO Compliance on Autopilot”
- Subheadline: short, professional (life sciences, audit readiness).
- Primary CTA button: “Run Free Assessment” (teal).
- Right side: Product mock preview area showing:
  - Risk Score gauge (with example 7.2)
  - Gap Analysis status tiles (Major Gaps, Moderate Gaps, Compliant)
  - Audit-ready PDF preview card
- Include a subtle vertical split label under the preview: “Manual Process | AI Engine”

Proof Pillars (3 small cards under hero)
- Card 1: “90% Faster Regulatory Reviews”
- Card 2: “Audit-Ready in 2 Clicks”
- Card 3: “100% Traceable Evidence Trails”
- Minimal icons, consistent spacing.

How It Works (process row)
- Horizontal 4-step flow with icons and arrows:
  - Upload SOP → AI Gap Analysis → Resolve Actions → Generate Audit-Ready Evidence

Product Preview Visualization band (right-side panel feel as in screenshot)
- Dark navy section titled “Product Preview Visualisation”
- Short row or small diagram repeating the 4-step flow
- Button inside: “Run Free Assessment”

Use-case area (right-side panel feel)
- Section title: “Use-case”
- Two small lists:
  - Product promise (2–3 bullets)
  - Use-case unlock (2–3 bullets)
- Keep concise.

Trust bar
- Dark band with badges: “FDA • EMA • ISO 13485” and “Biotech • Pharma • Medical Device”
- Add subtle iconography, no external logos required.

FAQ section
- Accordion with 4 items:
  - What is ComplianceWorxs?
  - How is data isolated?
  - How do we score regulatory impact?
  - What are the options for audit-ready exports?
- Accordion must work with lightweight JS.

Final CTA band
- Dark navy background with CTA copy and teal button “Run Free Assessment”.

Footer
- Links: FAQ | Terms | Privacy
- Terms and Privacy should be simple static pages: /terms and /privacy with clean headings and placeholder compliance language (no legal advice).
- Footer includes small ComplianceWorxs mark on right.

Technical Requirements (static export)
- Build using a static React website OR plain HTML/CSS/JS, but must be exportable as static assets.
- Do not use server-only routing. If using React, ensure it builds to static files and routes work via simple pages or hash anchors (so it works on SiteGround without special config).
- Add smooth-scroll for anchor links.
- Make fully responsive: desktop matches screenshot layout; mobile stacks cleanly.

Deliverable
- Provide an exportable static build suitable for uploading to SiteGround.
