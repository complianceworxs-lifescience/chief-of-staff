To build the Cognitive Enterprise system we've discussed, you'll need to add a new agent and upgrade the capabilities of your existing agents and dashboard. Here is the functional build plan.

1. Build the Market Intelligence Layer
This capability moves your system from being internally focused to externally aware.

New Agent to Build: Market Intelligence Agent (MIA)

Web Scraping & API Integration: Build modules to connect to and pull data from external sources like regulatory websites (FDA, EMA), financial news APIs, and competitor social media feeds.

NLP Summarization Engine: Implement a natural language processing model that can read long articles or regulatory documents and distill them into concise, actionable summaries.

Signal Detection & Alerting: Create a system that can identify significant events (e.g., a competitor launching a new service, a new draft guidance release) and flag them as "strategic signals" for the Chief of Staff.

2. Upgrade the "Chief of Staff" to a Generative Strategist
This transforms your CEO Agent from an orchestrator of pre-defined plans into a creative strategist.

Multi-Agent Problem Diagnosis: Upgrade its analytical capabilities to correlate data between agents. For example, it must be able to connect the CMO Agent's high ad spend with the CRO Agent's low lead quality to diagnose a persona-mismatch problem.

Generative Planning Module: This is a major development. You need to integrate an advanced AI model that can create novel, multi-step strategic plans from scratch when faced with a complex problem. This plan would include assigning different tasks to various agents, setting sub-goals, and defining a timeline.

Automated A/B Testing Framework: Build the functionality for the Chief of Staff to design, launch (via the CMO Agent), and analyze the results of A/B tests to continuously optimize marketing strategies.

3. Implement Dynamic Resource Orchestration
This capability allows the system to manage its human and financial resources autonomously.

Upgrade the COO Agent:

Partner & Skills Database: Create a structured database to house the skills, availability, performance ratings, and current workload of your EDP and AIP partners.

Project-to-Partner Matching Algorithm: Build a system that takes incoming project requirements and automatically matches them to the best-fit partner in the database.

Upgrade the CFO Agent:

Automated Payment Integration: Integrate with a payment processing API (like Stripe, Wise, or a bank API) to allow the CFO Agent to autonomously trigger payments to partners upon project completion confirmation from the COO Agent.

4. Enhance the "Glass Box" UI for Advanced Control
Your dashboard needs to evolve to manage this new level of autonomy.

Upgrade the Agent Status Monitoring Dashboard:

"Explainability" Drill-Down: The drill-down view for an agent in Conflict or Delayed status should include a plain-language summary generated by the agent explaining why it has that status. For example: "My status is 'Conflict' because my Strategic Alignment of 82% is below the 85% threshold."

Policy Management Interface: Create a new settings area where you can define and edit the "Rules of Engagement" that govern the Chief of Staff's autonomous decisions (e.g., setting budget limits, defining autonomy levels).

Live Strategy Visualization: Build a new view that shows any active "Generative Strategy" as a flowchart, so you can see the multi-step plan in real-time and which agent is responsible for each stage.
