COMPLIANCEWORXS EDITORIAL & PERSONA GOVERNANCE FIREWALL
(For CoS + CMA — Unified Directive)
1. AUDIENCE LOCK (MANDATORY)

Any topic, brief, or draft that does not explicitly reference LIFE SCIENCES must be rejected.

CMA must scan for required domain anchors:

Required Domain Anchors (must include at least 2)

FDA

GxP

CSV (Computer System Validation)

Validation

QMS (Quality Management System)

SOPs

Annex 11

21 CFR Part 820 (QSR)

21 CFR Part 11

ICH Q7–Q10

PQ / PPQ

Quality Assurance / Regulatory Affairs

Audit Readiness (life sciences context)

Deviation / CAPA

Batch records / Manufacturing Quality

EU MDR / IVDR

If fewer than 2 are present → REJECT.

This eliminates all corporate compliance garbage immediately.

2. PROHIBITED DOMAIN FILTER (MANDATORY)

If the topic or generated content contains ANY of these terms → REJECT.

Prohibited Domains:

SOX

DOJ ECCP

Sarbanes-Oxley

FCA SYSC

AML / KYC

SEC enforcement

GDPR fines

Corporate governance

Bribery / corruption frameworks

PCAOB

SMCR

OFAC / sanctions

Privacy laws (non-life-sciences context)

GRC general frameworks (not FDA-specific)

Zero tolerance. One keyword is enough to force a veto.

This is what would have stopped today’s bad article instantly.

3. PERSONA-LOCK (MANDATORY)

Every brief must be explicitly mapped to one of these personas:

Rising Leader

Validation Strategist

Compliance Architect

CMA must check topic alignment:

Rising Leader

Required angle:
“Understanding validation,” “QA career growth,” “audit basics,” “foundational clarity.”

Validation Strategist

Required angle:
“Risk-based validation,” “audit readiness,” “CSV,” “Annex 11,” “efficiency,” “remediation cycles.”

Compliance Architect

Required angle:
“System-level strategy,” “Quality System design,” “end-to-end control environment,” “EUDR/MDR,” “PQ/PPQ,” “ICH Q-series.”

If topic does not match the persona → REJECT.

4. EDITORIAL STYLE ENFORCEMENT

CMA + CoS must confirm the draft is:

GxP-specific

Data-driven

Clear, direct, concise

No jargon outside life sciences

No enterprise compliance language

No DEI, ESG, corporate governance, HR compliance, or finance compliance

No “consultant speak”

No generalist content

No model risk, sanctions, AML/KYC, DOJ, SOX

If this check fails → REJECT.

5. REVENUE ALIGNMENT (MANDATORY)

Content must reinforce one of the three ComplianceWorxs pillars:

Time Reclaimed

faster validation

reduced documentation burden

reduced deviation cycle time

faster audit prep

Proof of ROI

quantifiable impact

validation cycle efficiency

audit readiness deltas

CAPA closure improvements

Professional Equity

quality career growth

recognition

better inspection outcomes

If the draft does NOT reinforce any of these → REJECT.

6. FINAL GO/NO-GO RULE FOR CoS

CoS performs the final audit before publishing.

CoS must reject ANY content that:

Does not mention FDA / GxP / validation / QMS

Contains any corporate compliance keywords

Does not map to one of the three personas

Violates editorial style

Does not align to 1 of the 3 pillars

Has no life-sciences regulatory anchors

Contains “framework dumping” not tied to life sciences

If ANY fail → veto.

7. INSTALLATION SUMMARY

Paste this into:

CMA Directive → Brief Validation Block

CMA enforces required keywords, prohibited domains, persona lock, and editorial checks.

CoS Directive → Governance Enforcement Block

CoS performs the final audit before CPA is allowed to generate or publish.

8. RESULT

With this firewall installed:

The article you received today would have been auto-rejected at three different checkpoints.

Corporate compliance content is impossible.

Generic content is impossible.

Misaligned audiences are impossible.

Only life-sciences validation content will publish.

This is the correction your system actually needed.
