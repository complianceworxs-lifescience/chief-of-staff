Here’s a clean, working map of the Life Sciences Compliance ecosystem—what exists, how it connects, and where to instrument it with agents.

1) Authorities & Frameworks (the rules)

Regulators: FDA (CDER/CBER/CDRH), EMA, MHRA, PMDA, Health Canada, WHO, PIC/S, Notified Bodies (EU).

Core regs/guides: GMP (21 CFR 210/211, EU GMP), GCP (ICH E6), GLP (21 CFR 58), GVP (ICH E2/GVP Modules), Medical devices (EU MDR/IVDR; US QMSR aligned to ISO 13485), Data/IT (21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11), Risk (ICH Q9), Quality (ICH Q10), QbD (ICH Q8), Software (ISO 13485, ISO 14971 risk, IEC 62304 SW lifecycle), Supply chain (DSCSA/FMD), Privacy (HIPAA/GDPR).

2) Enterprise Quality System (how companies operationalize)

Document control (policies/SOPs/WIs/forms), Training/LMS, Change control, Deviation/NC, CAPA, Complaint handling, Supplier quality, Audits, Management review, Metrics.

3) Risk & Validation (assurance layer)

Computerized systems: CSV/CSA; lifecycle docs (URS/FS/DS, IQ/OQ/PQ, test plans/reports), Part 11/Annex 11 controls, audit trails.

Process & equipment: Process validation (PPQ, CPV), cleaning & method validation, equipment qualification.

Data integrity: ALCOA+, access control, audit trail review, backup/restore tests.

4) GxP Domains & Processes (where work happens)

GMP (manufacturing/quality): Batch records (EBR), release, QC testing, stability, complaints/returns, serialization, recalls.

GCP (clinical): Protocol/IB, eConsent, EDC/SDTM, monitoring/SDV, deviations, safety reporting, eTMF completeness, site/vendor oversight.

GLP (nonclinical): Study plans, raw data capture, QA statements, archive.

GVP (pharmacovigilance): Case intake/processing, signal detection, PSUR/PBRER, RMP, literature monitoring.

Medical Devices: Design controls (DHF), DMR/DHR, usability, SW files, UDI, post-market surveillance.

5) Systems & Data (the tooling landscape)

QMS/eQMS, DMS/EDMS, LMS, LIMS/ELN, MES/EBR, ERP, EDC/CTMS/IRT, PV safety DB (Argus/Aris), Serialization, DHF/PLM, BI/Reporting.

Evidence objects: controlled docs, training records, change/Deviation/CAPA, validation packages, batch/EBR, TMF artifacts, PV cases, audit findings, supplier scorecards.

6) External Actors (the extended enterprise)

CROs, CDMOs/CMOs, central labs, distributors/3PL, cloud/SaaS providers, IRBs/Ethics committees, Notified Bodies, suppliers.

Requires contracts (QAA/QTA), vendor qualification, ongoing oversight, and shared validation responsibilities.

7) Oversight & Assurance (closing the loop)

Internal/supplier audits, health-authority inspections, NB audits, management review.

Core KPIs: Right-first-time, deviation/CAPA cycle time & effectiveness, training on-time %, TMF completeness, PV case timeliness, data-integrity observation rate, CPV trends, supplier ratings.

8) Typical failure modes (where value leaks)

Doc sprawl/version drift, manual reconciliations, weak change control, poor vendor oversight, incomplete validation/evidence, fragmented master data, audit-trail neglect.

How to operationalize this with agents (ComplianceWorxs lens)

Regulatory Intelligence (CCO Agent)

Ingest official sources (FDA/EMA/MHRA), warning letters, guidance updates → classify to domains (GMP/GCP/…); auto-open change controls, draft SOP diffs, create training tasks.

Validation & Data Integrity (CCO/COO)

Maintain a system inventory with CSV/CSA status, Part 11 controls, audit-trail review cadence; flag gaps; generate IQ/OQ/PQ evidence packs.

Quality Operations (COO)

Watch deviations → risk-score → auto-link to CAPA; enforce effectiveness checks; surface CPV exceptions.

Clinical & TMF (COO/CCO)

Monitor eTMF completeness by artifact; alert on critical gaps (e.g., IB, consent, SAE letters); tie to site/vendor scorecards.

Manufacturing (COO)

Track EBR exceptions, environmental excursions, stability trends; escalate to QA release gates.

Pharmacovigilance (CCO)

SLA watchdog for case processing, literature surveillance, signal review minutes; push non-compliance to CAPA.

Executive View (CEO/CRO/CMO)

Compliance risk heatmap alongside revenue roadmap; “no-go” gates driven by CCO rules; partner/vendor risk ratings.

Minimal data model you need (to make dashboards truthful)

entities: product, study, site, supplier, system, process, document, training, deviation, CAPA, audit, validation_package, pv_case, batch.

signals: {source, domain, severity, requirement_ref, linked_entities[], due_date, owner, status, evidence_refs[]}.

governance rules: mapping from signal.domain + severity → owner (CCO/COO/…); auto-actions (open CAPA, launch change control, trigger training).

Quick win checklist (turnkey)

Configure regulatory watchlist + scrapers; route to “signals”.

Build a system inventory & validation status table (CSV/CSA) with Part 11 controls and audit-trail review dates.

Instrument deviation→CAPA pipeline with timers & effectiveness checks.

Add TMF completeness % and PV SLA cards.

Show freshness stamps (last sync/run) on every widget; alert when stale.

This map is the whole playing field. If you want, I’ll convert it into a one-page operating diagram and a JSON schema you can drop into your Replit agents for unified signal intake and routing.

Here’s the fastest way to feed your ecosystem → Market Intelligence dashboard in Replit.

1) Paste this watchlist/config (ready to post)

Save as MI_WATCHLIST.json (or post it directly to your config API).

{
  "version": "1.0",
  "priority_threshold": 0.6,
  "keywords": [
    "21 CFR Part 11", "Annex 11", "ALCOA+", "CSV", "CSA",
    "process validation", "cleaning validation", "equipment qualification",
    "deviation", "CAPA", "audit trail", "eTMF", "PSUR", "PBRER",
    "QMS", "LIMS", "MES", "eQMS", "ELN", "GxP cloud"
  ],
  "topics": {
    "regulatory": ["warning letter", "483", "inspection", "inspection closeout", "guidance", "MDR", "IVDR", "GMP", "GCP", "GLP", "GVP"],
    "competitive": ["product launch", "case study", "customer win", "pricing", "partnership", "integration", "hiring VP", "funding"],
    "market": ["RFP", "RFI", "RFQ", "trend", "benchmark", "industry report"],
    "technology": ["AI", "machine learning", "automation", "composable", "data platform", "API", "audit trail review"]
  },
  "regulators": [
    { "name": "FDA", "domains": ["fda.gov"] },
    { "name": "EMA", "domains": ["ema.europa.eu"] },
    { "name": "MHRA", "domains": ["gov.uk"] },
    { "name": "Health Canada", "domains": ["canada.ca"] }
  ],
  "competitors": [
    "flinn.ai", "valgenesis.com", "kneat.com", "mastercontrol.com",

  ],
  "boosts": {
    "severity_terms": { "warning letter": 0.4, "483": 0.35, "guidance": 0.25, "Part 11": 0.2, "Annex 11": 0.2 },
    "domains": { "fda.gov": 0.5, "ema.europa.eu": 0.4, "gov.uk": 0.3, "canada.ca": 0.25 }
  },
  "auto_assign": {

    "competitive": "CRO",
    "market": "CEO",
    "technology": "COO"
  }
}


What this gives you: a ready-made watchlist that maps the ecosystem to MI categories and agent owners.

2) API contract your dashboard should already use

Your CoS “Gather Intelligence” button must call this orchestrator (not autonomy):

POST /api/mi/ingest-and-score → returns:

{ "ok": true, "stats": { "total": 7, "high_priority": 3, "processed_today": 7, "assignments": 3, "last_run_at": "ISO" } }


Dashboard reads:

GET /api/mi/stats → same shape as stats above

GET /api/mi/active → array of signals:

[{
  "id":"a1","title":"FDA Warning Letter","url":"...","source":"fda.gov",
  "category":"regulatory","priority":0.92,"assigned_to":"CCO"
}]


If you don’t have these endpoints yet, use the skeleton we already discussed; your button should fetch("/api/mi/ingest-and-score",{method:"POST"}) then mutate("/api/mi/stats") and mutate("/api/mi/active").

3) Post the config and run (exact commands)

From the Replit Shell:

# 1) Upload/commit MI_WATCHLIST.json, then:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mi/config \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @MI_WATCHLIST.json

# 2) Kick the orchestrator (what the CoS button should call)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mi/ingest-and-score

# 3) Confirm the dashboard feed has data
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/mi/stats
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/mi/active | head


If stats.total > 0, your UI should no longer show zeros. If it still does, you’re not refreshing the two endpoints above—wire the button to invalidate them.

4) Minimal scoring logic (drop-in, if you need it)

This aligns with the config above and keeps code simple/deterministic.

// services/mi/scorer.ts
export const MiScorer = {
  score(raw: any[], cfg: any) {
    const kw = new Set(cfg.keywords.map((k: string) => k.toLowerCase()));
    const sev = cfg.boosts?.severity_terms ?? {};
    const dom = cfg.boosts?.domains ?? {};
    const th = cfg.priority_threshold ?? 0.6;

    return raw.map((r) => {
      const text = `${r.title} ${r.snippet ?? ""}`.toLowerCase();
      const base =
        r.kind === "regulatory" ? 0.55 :
        r.kind === "competitive" ? 0.45 :
        r.kind === "market" ? 0.4 : 0.35;

      let boost = 0;
      for (const [term, w] of Object.entries(sev)) if (text.includes(term)) boost += Number(w);
      if (r.source) for (const [d, w] of Object.entries(dom)) if (r.source.includes(d)) boost += Number(w);
      for (const k of kw) if (text.includes(k)) { boost += 0.05; break; }

      const priority = Math.min(1, base + boost);
      const category = r.kind ?? "market";
      const assigned_to = cfg.auto_assign?.[category] ?? "COO";

      return { ...r, category, priority, assigned_to, high_priority: priority >= th };
    });
  }
};

5) Make the CoS dashboard truthful (1-minute UI patch)

After the button runs, force-refresh:

await Promise.all([mutate("/api/mi/stats"), mutate("/api/mi/active")]);


Show freshness: “Last run: stats.last_run_at”.

If NO_CONFIG from the orchestrator, render the empty-state CTA: “Add Watchlist & Sources”.

6) Optional: schedule it

Add a tiny cron (e.g., every 30–60 min) that calls POST /api/mi/ingest-and-score so signals stay fresh without you.
