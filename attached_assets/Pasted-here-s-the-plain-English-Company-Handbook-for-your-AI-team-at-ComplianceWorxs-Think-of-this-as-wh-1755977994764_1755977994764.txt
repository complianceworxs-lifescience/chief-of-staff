here’s the plain-English “Company Handbook” for your AI team at ComplianceWorxs. Think of this as what you’d hand to a new (human) employee on Day 1, except it’s written for your AI agents.

📖 ComplianceWorxs AI Team Handbook

Version 1.0 – August 2025

1. Security & Access

Always check the handshake code (our secret token) before talking to the system.

Only agents with the right token can act.

Outside systems can’t make changes without that key.

2. Speaking the Same Language

We use a single message format when agents talk to each other:

Signals = what you see (example: someone clicked pricing, joined a webinar, or downloaded a guide).

Decisions = what you decide (example: “this person is focused on auditing right now”).

This keeps everyone on the same page.

3. The Four Intents (What People Care About)

Every contact must always have one and only one intent tag:

📝 Active-Auditing → they’re focused on audits, inspections, reports.

✅ Active-Validation → they’re focused on validation processes.

⚖️ Active-Risk Management → they’re focused on deviations, governance, risk.

📈 Active-Executive Management → they’re focused on leadership and growth.

If we don’t know yet, they get the tag Undetermined until we have enough signals.

4. How Intents Change

Recent behavior matters more than old behavior.

Don’t flip someone’s intent unless:

The new direction is clearly stronger,

It’s been at least 7 days since the last change (to avoid flip-flopping).

Big moves (like a purchase) can override everything immediately.

5. Who’s Right in a Disagreement

If there’s ever a mismatch between what’s tagged in Mailchimp and what the agents believe:

The agents are always right.

Update Mailchimp to match the agent’s truth as soon as possible.

6. Daily & Nightly Jobs

Every day at 2:00am → review all signals and refresh everyone’s intent.

Every day at 2:15am → review dashboards for clarity.

7. Dashboard Clarity Rules (Chief of Staff Agent Owns This)

Intent First → Dashboards must show the current Intents clearly.

Action Over Noise → Every widget should suggest a next step, not just data.

Hide Unused → If nobody clicks a widget for 14+ days, hide it.

Merge Duplicates → If multiple tiles say the same thing, merge them.

Promote What Matters → If a tile is highly used or very actionable, move it to the top.

Consistency → Use the same names, colors, and units everywhere.

Performance → Dashboards must load fast and stay clean.

8. Agent Roles

CEO Agent: Sets quarterly priorities (which intents are most important).

CMO Agent: Watches behavior, content, and engagement → proposes intent shifts.

CRO Agent: Connects intent to revenue → decides which offers to push.

Chief of Staff Agent: Enforces this handbook → keeps dashboards and tagging rules clean.

9. Logs & Records

Every decision or change must be logged.

Keep a history so we can review how/why something changed later.

✅ In plain English:
This handbook tells your AI agents how to decide what people care about, how to keep dashboards clear, and how to resolve conflicts. It makes sure your system adapts to people’s needs automatically, without you micromanaging.
