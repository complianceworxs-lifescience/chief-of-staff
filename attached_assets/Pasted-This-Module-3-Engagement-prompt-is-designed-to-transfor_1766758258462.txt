This Module 3: Engagement prompt is designed to transform the portal from a static site into a dynamic intelligence hub. It leverages your 13,000-member LinkedIn group by providing a destination for high-value regulatory content and real-time updates.

Grouped Prompt: Module 3 (Blog & Regulatory Feed)
Copy and paste the following into the Replit Agent to finalize your content strategy:

@replit Implement the Blog and Regulatory Feed using a modular structure (blog.html, post.html) and the 2025 Pharma Palette.

1. Regulatory Feed (Live Intelligence)
Header: "Real-Time Regulatory Intelligence Feed."

Functionality: Create a sidebar or top-strip ticker showing the latest simulated updates for FDA (21 CFR 820), EMA (GMP), and ISO 13485.

Visuals: Use 2025 Coral (#FF6B6B) for "Critical Final Rules" and Teal (#00A3A1) for "Draft Guidance."

2. Blog Engine (Authority Content)
Layout: A clean grid of cards featuring a title, category tag, and "3 min read" estimate.

Seed Content (3 Placeholder Posts):

Post 1: "Navigating the 2025 ISO 13485 Revisions: A Practical Guide."

Post 2: "AI in GxP: Maintaining 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance in Automated Systems."

Post 3: "The Cost of Non-Conformance: Why ROI-Driven Compliance is the Future."

Engagement Features: Add a "Share to LinkedIn" button on post pages and a "Subscribe to Regulatory Alerts" email capture box.

3. Design & Routing
Background: Maintain the Off-white (#F9FAFB) base with high-contrast Charcoal text for readability.

Navigation: Update the header "Blog" link to point to blog.html.

Architecture: Ensure all styles are appended to style.css and logic to script.js.

Strategic Impact
Authority: Frequent regulatory updates position ComplianceWorxs as an "insider" rather than just a software vendor.

Retention: The email alert capture turns one-time blog readers into recurring portal users.

L5.5 Integration: The "Regulatory Feed" can eventually be connected to your AI agents to trigger automatic Gap Analysis notifications for users.
