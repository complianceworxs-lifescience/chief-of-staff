L6 Upgrade Requirements

Objective: Add learning without loosening a single governance constraint.

Your system is already stable (100% VQS compliance, 9/9 governance rules enforced, green integrations, 3 active ODAR cycles).
L6 adds memory + adaptation. Nothing else changes.

1. Add the Performance Ledger (Scoreboard)

L6 requires one new subsystem:

Performance Ledger = the memory of what works.
It becomes the single place where Gemini records:

Problem angle used

VQS metric band used

Subject line pattern

Doctrine score

Engagement outcome

Booked calls or revenue attribution

This is the “learning substrate.”
No ledger = no learning = stuck at L5.

Status required for L6: Ledger deployed, reads and writes stable.

2. Add Outcome Ingestion (Mailchimp Webhooks → Ledger)

L5 only validates content.

L6 connects outcomes to content through webhooks:

open

click

reply

positive reply

booked_call

optional: revenue tags from your CRM

Status required for L6:
Webhook → API endpoint → Ledger writes successful.

This gives the Strategist “eyes.”

3. Add Variant Attribution

Every email must be tagged with:

variant_id

problem_angle

vqs_band

persona

tone_style

cta_type

This allows the Strategist to compare A vs B vs C under identical constraints.

4. Add L6 Optimization Loop

This is the single logic upgrade that distinguishes L6:

If Angles with “Hidden Cost” outperform “ROI Visibility” by X%,
then bias new generation toward “Hidden Cost” —
but still within all VQS constraints and Doctrine rules.

This is adaptive optimization, not rule relaxation.

Required:

Weighted scoring function

Bias update rule

Enforcement that all generated outputs still run through the Doctrine Validator (unchanged from L5)

5. Retain Immutable Constraints (Non-Negotiable for VQS Integrity)

To avoid violations, the following stay read-only:

14–28%

$18k–$72k

15–35%

Forbidden vocabulary list

Problem-first lead requirement

Minimum 2/3 Pillars for passing

7-Step Operating Standard

72-hour throttle

L6 cannot change these.
These form the “wall” around experimentation.

6. Add Safety Escalation (Optional but Recommended)

If any variant drops below a performance floor (e.g., 0 booked calls over N sends):

Auto-freeze that angle

Back off; revert to prior winning pattern

Flag for human review if needed

This keeps optimization safe and contained.

7. Validate End-to-End

Before declaring L6, the system must demonstrate:

10+ sends logged into the Ledger

Outcomes ingested

At least 2 hypothesis families evaluated

Strategist adjusts variant selection using performance data

Zero Validator bypasses

Zero VQS violations

Summary: What It Takes to Reach L6

Required components:

Scoreboard (Performance Ledger)

Outcome ingestion via Mailchimp → Ledger

Variant tagging and metadata

Optimization loop with biasing

Immutable VQS + Doctrine constraints

Fail-safe freeze logic

End-to-end validation with no violations

When these 7 are live, your system has:

Memory

Strategy

Self-adjustment

No drift

No violations

No additional risk

Exactly what L6 is meant to deliver.
