I see what you mean. Right now your Chief of Staff dashboard shows “Goals & Priorities” as empty, while your system already uses Directives elsewhere. That mismatch will frustrate you because goals ≠ directives, and neither currently shows you what matters most:

What’s happening now (status reporting).

Where attention is needed (exceptions / at risk).

What’s next (agent actions).

Here’s what I’d recommend to turn this into a reporting + action hub that agents can run without you:

🔹 1. Align Terminology & Structure

Rename “Goals & Priorities” to Strategic Objectives (big-picture outcomes).

Keep “Directives” as operational instructions (what agents execute).

Connect them: each directive rolls up to an objective.

👉 That way you don’t have two disconnected layers.

🔹 2. Add Live Metrics & Signals

Each dashboard card should pull agent-reported data in real time:

Progress % toward objectives (auto-calculated).

Exceptions surfaced (e.g. auto-resolve < 85%, MTTR > 5m, revenue below target).

Agent interventions logged (which ones acted without you).

Example cards:

Revenue Run Rate Today

Autonomy Health (Green/Yellow/Red)

Escalations in Last 24h

🔹 3. Actionable Controls for Agents

Instead of just showing you numbers, the dashboard should let agents take action directly:

“Resolve” button → triggers agent workflow.

“Escalate” button → moves issue to COO agent.

“Reassign” → CRO agent picks up from CMO agent if sales > marketing.

That way, the dashboard isn’t for you to click around — it’s a command surface for agents.

🔹 4. Daily Signal Board

At the very top, a strip with 3 things only (your Steve Jobs signal-to-noise):

Revenue Hooks (are CTAs converting?)

Autonomy Metrics (are agents green?)

Messaging (is the outbound push live?)

If all are ✅, you stay out.

⚡Bottom line:
Turn this from a “pretty but empty scorecard” into a living execution console that:

Links directives ↔ objectives.

Surfaces only exceptions (signal).

Lets agents act directly from the dashboard without you.
