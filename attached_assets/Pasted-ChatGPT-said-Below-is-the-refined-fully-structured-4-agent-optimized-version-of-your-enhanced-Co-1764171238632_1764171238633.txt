New Daily Strategic Cycle (Mandatory):

Execute: PFL → CSI → SVDP in sequence

PFL: Eliminate emerging objections

CSI: Detect competitor shifts ≤ 72 hours

SVDP: Maintain predictive revenue ≥ 85%

If any step fails:
CoS must initiate a rapid 12-hour correction cycle.

CoS DIRECTIVE — INTEGRATION MANDATE (Binding)

The Chief of Staff must integrate and enforce the following three metrics immediately:

1. Feature Objection Rate (PFL)

Track daily.

Must trend downward week-over-week.

2. MTTD ≤ 72 Hours (CSI)

Competitor signals must be detected within 3 days.

If not, CMO priority switches to signal scanning.

3. Revenue Predictability ≥ 85% (SVDP)

If RPM forecast drops below threshold →
Content Manager must publish a VQS Defense Asset same-day
and CRO must refresh micro-offer sequencing.

Failure to enforce = Red-Flag Escalation to Strategist.
