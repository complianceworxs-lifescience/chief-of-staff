Below is a clean, operational Post-Launch Monitoring Protocol covering the 08:00–12:00 EST Monday window.
It uses your three required signals and outputs a clear “Watch List” that defines what success looks like.

POST-LAUNCH MONITORING PROTOCOL (08:00–12:00 EST)

L6 / L5 Integrated Revenue Prime Monitoring Stack

The system will perform continuous Pulse Checks every 5 minutes across the three launch-critical signals.
All checks run autonomously; the Chairman is only alerted if thresholds are violated.

PULSE CHECK A — EMAIL OPEN VELOCITY (“The Spear”)

Purpose: Detect audience activation and funnel acceleration.

Metrics Collected (every 5 min)

Open Rate (rolling)

Unique Opens

Time-to-Open Velocity

Segment-specific activation (Rising Leader, Strategist, Architect)

Thresholds

GREEN: ≥ 22% open rate in first hour; upward trend.

YELLOW: 12–21% first-hour open rate; flat trend.

RED: < 12% first-hour open rate; declining.

Actions (Autonomous)

L6: Score visibility → flagged if YELLOW or RED.

L5: Adjust send-timing for delayed segments if within safe Tier 2 rules.

Alert Chairman only if RED sustained for 30 min.

PULSE CHECK B — CHECKOUT RECOVERY SUCCESS (“The Safety Net”)

Purpose: Measure the effectiveness of the abandonment rescue logic.

Metrics Collected (every 5 min)

Abandonment Events

Recovery Email Trigger Rate

Click-Back Rate to Checkout

Recovery Conversion (recovered sales)

60-min Rescue Window compliance

Thresholds

GREEN: ≥ 35% recovery click-back; ≥ 10% recovered conversions.

YELLOW: 20–34% click-back; 5–9% recovered conversions.

RED: < 20% click-back or < 5% conversions.

Actions (Autonomous)

L6: Friction Map + Propensity-to-Pay update.

L5: If YELLOW, may intensify recovery email within templates.

Alert Chairman only if RED persists for 45 min.

PULSE CHECK C — REVENUE ATTRIBUTION (“The Webhook”)

Purpose: Verify Stripe Webhook is operational + tie every dollar to its source.

Metrics Collected (every 5 min)

Live payment events

Attribution (email → click → checkout → payment)

Conversion velocity (per 15 min segment)

Cart value distribution

Account tier purchased (if applicable)

Thresholds

GREEN: Successful attribution for ≥ 95% of events; consistent flow.

YELLOW: 80–94% attribution; some missing source data.

RED: < 80% attribution OR webhook silence > 20 minutes.

Actions (Autonomous)

L6: Re-compute attribution confidence; validate link path integrity.

L5: Auto-restart attribution listener if signal drops (Tier 1 safe).

Alert Chairman if RED at any point.

WATCH LIST FOR THE CHAIRMAN (WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE)
1. Email Open Velocity — SUCCESS looks like:

First-hour open rate ≥ 22%

Consistent upward velocity

Segment activation within expected ranges

Zero drift in Archetype H tone interactions

2. Checkout Recovery — SUCCESS looks like:

High initial abandonment (normal)

35%+ click-back from recovery email

10%+ recovered conversions

Drop-off curve flattening by Hour 3

3. Revenue Attribution — SUCCESS looks like:

Webhook firing reliably within 0–3 seconds

95%+ attribution accuracy

Clean linkage: Email → Checkout → Payment

Revenue flowing from the $500 offer as the primary source

SUMMARY (What the Chairman Should Expect)

If all three signals remain GREEN or YELLOW, the system is performing normally.
If any RED threshold is hit, you are notified instantly with cause + proposed corrective action.

If you want, I can now generate the Monday Morning Launch “Flight Deck” — a single-screen summary UI of these signals formatted for your dashboard.
