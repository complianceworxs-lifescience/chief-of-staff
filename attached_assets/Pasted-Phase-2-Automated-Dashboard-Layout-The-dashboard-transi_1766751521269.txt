Phase 2: Automated Dashboard Layout
The dashboard transitions the user from the "Marketing Hero" section into the "Strategic Architecture" environment. Its primary objective is to present high-level compliance health with a clean, data-driven interface.

1. Global Navigation Sidebar
Compliance Monitor: Real-time feed of FDA and ISO updates relevant to the firm.

SOP Repository: Centralized storage for uploaded procedures and their assessment status.

Gap Analysis Engine: Active workspace for identifying and resolving documentation deficiencies.

Audit Vault: Secure export center for Audit-Ready PDFs and Compliance Certificates.

2. The Command Center (Main View)
Executive Impact Score: A large gauge (1-10) showing current organizational risk based on recent regulatory changes.

Active Gaps Summary: A horizontal strip showing the count of Major, Moderate, and Minor gaps across all uploaded SOPs.

Regulatory Runway: A timeline showing upcoming effective dates for new FDA Final Rules or ISO revisions.

@replit Implement the Phase 2 Dashboard Layout for ComplianceWorxs:

Layout Architecture: Create a persistent sidebar (Navy #002D62) and a spacious white main content area (#F9FAFB).

Hero Component: Implement a centered Risk Score Gauge using SVG or a chart library, defaulted to 0.0 until the first SOP is uploaded.

Data Grid: Build the "Gap Analysis Preview" table with columns for Document Name, Regulatory Standard, and Status Badge (Red/Yellow/Green).

Empty State Logic: If no SOP is uploaded, display a prominent Teal button (#00A3A1) in the center: "Upload First SOP to Begin Assessment."

Why this follows the "Architect" Persona
Objective-First: The layout prioritizes data (The Risk Score) over decorative elements.

Zero-Touch Scalability: The "Empty State" design ensures the user knows the next operational step without manual instruction.

Audit-Grade Credibility: Using a sidebar-focused navigation mimics standard Quality Management System (QMS) software, immediately establishing trust with QA leads.
