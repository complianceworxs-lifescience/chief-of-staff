@replit build a pixel-faithful STATIC marketing homepage for ComplianceWorxs that replicates the attached screenshot. IMPORTANT: optimize for SiteGround where folder uploads and zip extraction are unreliable.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (must follow)
1) Output a SINGLE self-contained file: /public/index.html (or /index.html) with ALL CSS and JS inlined.
2) No external assets folders required (no /assets, /css, /js dependencies). All icons must be inline SVG. If you must use images, embed them as data URIs inside the HTML.
3) No CDN libraries. No external fonts. Use system font stack only.
4) All interactions (FAQ accordion, smooth-scroll) implemented with minimal inline JS.
5) Provide a clearly named file in the project root: complianceworxs-homepage-singlefile.html that is identical to index.html.

VISUAL TARGET (match screenshot layout)
A) Top Nav (white background)
- Left: ComplianceWorxs wordmark/logo (simple shield icon + text).
- Center menu: Overview | Pricing | Blog | FAQ
- Right: Log in (text link) + Sign Up (teal button).
- Sticky on scroll.

B) Hero (two-column)
- Left:
  - Headline: “FDA & ISO Compliance on Autopilot”
  - Subheadline: concise, professional (life sciences, audit readiness).
  - Primary CTA button (teal): “Run Free Assessment”
- Right (hero visual):
  - A split comparison panel with a thin vertical divider and labels under it: “Manual Process” (left) and “AI Engine” (right).
  - Manual side: spreadsheet-like mock (simple table).
  - AI side: dashboard mock with:
    - Risk score gauge showing ~7.2
    - Colored gap bars/tiles (red/yellow/green)
  - Keep this mock entirely HTML/CSS (no images required).

C) Proof Pillars Row (3 cards)
- Three horizontal cards with small icons + title:
  1) “90% Faster Regulatory Reviews”
  2) “Audit-Ready in 2 Clicks”
  3) “100% Traceable Evidence Trails”
- Style: light card, subtle shadow, consistent spacing.

D) How It Works (icon flow)
- Horizontal 4-step flow with icons + arrows:
  Upload SOP → AI Gap Analysis → Resolve Actions → Generate Audit-Ready Evidence

E) Right-side stacked panels (as in screenshot)
Create a right column area (or responsive stacked section) with these blocks:
1) “Product Preview Visualisation” (dark navy panel)
   - show mini 4-step flow + CTA button “Run Free Assessment”
2) “Use-case” (dark navy/white panel)
   - two small bullet lists: Product promise / Use-case unlock (short, readable)
3) Trust strip (dark navy band)
   - badges: “FDA • EMA • ISO 13485” and “Biotech • Pharma • Medical Device”
4) FAQ (accordion)
   - 4–6 questions; accordion open/close with chevrons
   - Include at least: “What is ComplianceWorxs?”, “How is data isolated?”, “Can I export reports?”, “Is there a setup fee?”
5) “CTA” panel (dark navy)
   - short line + teal “Run Free Assessment” button

F) Footer (minimal)
- Clean footer with ComplianceWorxs mark and links (can be anchor links): Terms | Privacy | FAQ
- Terms and Privacy must be included as in-page sections or modal overlays (still single-file).

COLOR + TYPOGRAPHY
- Navy: #002D62
- Teal: #00A3A1
- Background: #F9FAFB
- Cards: white with subtle border/shadow
- Font: system stack (e.g., -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Arial)
- No hype language. Executive-grade.

RESPONSIVE
- Desktop matches screenshot proportions.
- Mobile: stacks sections cleanly, buttons full width, nav collapses to simple hamburger.

DELIVERABLE / DEPLOYMENT NOTE
- Ensure the final site works by uploading ONLY index.html to SiteGround public_html.
- Do not require any other files to render correctly.

When finished, confirm in your response:
- “This homepage renders correctly with only index.html present.”
- “No external assets are required.”
