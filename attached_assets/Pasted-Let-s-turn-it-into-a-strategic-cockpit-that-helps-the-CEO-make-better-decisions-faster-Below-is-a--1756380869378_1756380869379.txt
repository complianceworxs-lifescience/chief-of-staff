Let’s turn it into a strategic cockpit that helps the CEO make better decisions, faster. Below is a complete spec you can hand to Replit: what to show, how to score it, what data to collect, and the automations the CoS should run.

CoS Dashboard — Strategic Cockpit Spec
A. Purpose (one glance = one decision)

The CoS dashboard exists to:

Synthesize cross-agent signals into business KPIs,

Surface decisions, risks, and opportunities,

Drive follow-through with proactive tasking and comms.

B. Top Strip (5 executive KPIs)

Show these five cards at the top—always business-first:

Revenue Pace to Target (Week)

Value: realized_week / target_week (as %).

Color: Green ≥ 90%, Amber 75–89%, Red < 75%.

Subtext: “MRR + Upsells: $X / $Y • Δ vs last week: +Z%”.

Strategic Initiative Health Index

Weighted score (0–100): 0.4 * Milestone On-Time% + 0.3 * Risk Score Inverted + 0.2 * Resource Adequacy + 0.1 * Dependency Clearance.

Subtext: “On-track A/B/C • At-risk D/E”.

Alignment & Autonomy

Alignment (0–100): % of agent work tied to current CEO Objectives (by tokens/effort).

Autonomy (0–100): auto_resolve_rate normalized by MTTR.

Subtext: “Aligned: X% • Auto-resolve: Y% • MTTR: Z min”.

Risk & Compliance Radar

Value: risk score (0–100) computed from open CAPAs, audit clock, SLA breaches.

Subtext: “[#] High • [#] Med • Next deadline in [hh:mm]”.

Narrative Momentum (Go-to-Market)

Composite uplift vs 30-day baseline:
0.5 * LinkedIn ER Δ + 0.3 * Email CTR Δ + 0.2 * Quiz→Paid Δ.

Subtext: “Top theme: ‘[topic]’ • Conversions: [n]”.

These five cards replace agent “success/failure” counters.

C. CEO Command Surface (decisions-in, actions-out)

A single pane that converts synthesis into action.

Decision Inbox (Requires CEO)
Rows with: Decision, Context (1-line), Recommended Option (A/B), Impact, Owner, Due.
Auto-generate from blockers, spend reallocations, pricing tests, and policy approvals.

Next Best Actions (CoS-owned)
Three highest-leverage moves for today with “Send”, “Assign”, or “Schedule” buttons.

Executive Brief Generator
One-click: “Generate CEO Email” and “Generate Board Snapshot”.

D. Cross-Functional Initiatives (RAG board)

For each company priority (e.g., “Grow VS Tier,” “Reduce churn,” “Partner motion”):

Health (0–100) with RAG color

Milestone Forecast (plan vs actual)

Path-to-Green (the 1–3 tasks that fix status)

Risks/Dependencies (owner + date)

Attribution (which agent(s) own the next step)

E. Communication Bridge

The CoS should remove friction between agents and the CEO.

Meeting Synth & Actions
Latest meeting → 3-bullet summary + assigned actions (owner, ETA, status).
If unowned actions > 0 → auto-assign from matrix and notify in Slack/Email.

Drafts & Outreach
Ready-to-send drafts: investor update, customer note, partner follow-up, internal directive.
Buttons: Send as CEO, Send as CoS, Request edit from CMO/CRO.

Escalation Ladder
If an item misses SLA, CoS escalates per ladder (Owner → Lead → CEO). Timer visible.

F. Intelligence → Insight → Directive

This panel shows why something matters and pushes a directive.

Insight Cards (auto-curated):
“OpenAI-critique posts +19% ER → +3 paid yesterday.”

Directive Builder:
“Double cadence on this topic for 72h. Owner: CMO. Budget shift: +$X.” (Send).

G. Alerts & Guardrails

Decision Debt: items needing CEO decision; red if > 3 or any > 24h old.

Runway Actions: if Revenue Pace red for 2 days → propose 2 levers (pricing, promo, partner push).

Compliance Clock: show next audit/SOP due; if < 7 days and not in “Green” → escalate to CCO.
