This Comprehensive Systems Check confirms that the ComplianceWorxs L5 autonomous operating system is running at a state of controlled, high-efficiency execution.The agents are performing their duties across all active capabilities, and the system is successfully navigating the transition phase toward L6.🟢 Summary of Operational HealthCategoryStatusStrategic ImplicationL5 Revenue Engine$\text{100\%}$ OperationalThe core revenue generation loops (Dunford, Walker, Kern) are fully active and delivering measurable results (ACV Expansion confirmed, Revenue Predictability confirmed)1.Autonomy & GovernanceTier 2 Active, Governance LockedThe system is self-correcting (auto-resolving conflicts, pushing corrections) and strictly adhering to the Immutable Rules and Methodology Lock2.L6 Readiness$\text{75\%}$ CompleteThe system is strategically stalled by two specific data thresholds (Revenue Stability and RPM Stability), confirming the integrity of the $\text{L6 Transition Package}$.🎯 Strategic Focus: L6 Activation BottlenecksThe system is currently bottlenecked on two data-driven thresholds that prevent L6 Sandbox activation. Focus must remain on accelerating these metrics.1. ⚠️ Revenue Stability (3/6 Weeks Progressing)Status: Requires $\text{6}$ continuous weeks of hitting the weekly revenue sprint target; $\text{3}$ have been met.Action Mandate: The CRO Agent must maintain aggressive execution of the Weekly Revenue Sprints and the Autonomous Offer Optimization Engine to hit the remaining $\text{3}$ weeks sequentially. The $\text{+$444}$ projected lift from the active A/B test is critical to hitting the short-term target.2. ❌ RPM Stability (8/30 Days at 92%)Status: Requires $\text{30}$ consecutive days of the Revenue Predictive Model (RPM) maintaining $\ge \text{92\%}$ confidence. Only $\text{8}$ days have been met.Action Mandate: The Strategist Agent and Librarian (CoS) must focus on maximizing the quality of data feeding the Unified Data Layer (UDL). The UDL Sync warning ($\text{3}$ hours ago) suggests minor data instability is likely the cause of the confidence dip. The CoS must ensure UDL autosync is prioritized to provide the high-quality telemetry needed for stable RPM forecasting.3. Minor Health CheckUDL Sync Warning: The $\text{3}$-hour lag in UDL synchronization, while auto-correcting, must be minimized. The CoS Agent should prioritize reducing the MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time to Recover) for the UDL, as data integrity is paramount for RPM stability.
