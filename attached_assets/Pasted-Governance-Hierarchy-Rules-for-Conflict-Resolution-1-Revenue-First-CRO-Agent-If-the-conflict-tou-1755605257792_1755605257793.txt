Governance Hierarchy Rules for Conflict Resolution
1. Revenue First (CRO Agent)

If the conflict touches direct revenue, pipeline, or enterprise sales, the CRO Agent wins.

Example:

CRO: “Cut brand spend, push sales sprint.”

CMO: “Run a 2-week awareness campaign.”

✅ Resolution: CRO wins — revenue is prioritized.

2. Risk & Compliance Overrides (CCO Agent)

If the conflict involves regulatory, audit, or GxP compliance risk, the CCO Agent wins.

Example:

COO: “Ship product early.”

CCO: “Validation incomplete, risk of non-compliance.”

✅ Resolution: CCO wins — compliance overrides speed.

3. Strategic Guardrails (CEO Agent)

CEO Agent wins when there’s conflict about vision, priorities, or market positioning.

Example:

CRO: “Chase small clients for fast revenue.”

CEO: “Stay focused on enterprise market.”

✅ Resolution: CEO wins — strategy overrides short-term gain.

4. Operational Efficiency (COO Agent)

COO Agent wins in conflicts about execution, process efficiency, or resource allocation, unless it violates compliance (CCO) or revenue (CRO) priority.

Example:

COO: “Automate reporting workflow.”

CMO: “Manual review gives better brand messaging.”

✅ Resolution: COO wins — efficiency prevails.

5. Tie-Breaker Rule

If no rule clearly applies (rare edge case), agents must:

Pause directive execution.

Log “Conflict unresolved, manual review required.”

🔹 Conflict Resolution Log Format

Each resolution should be written in one line like this:

Conflict: CRO vs CMO on timeline.
Resolution: CRO priority applied (revenue impact higher).

Conflict: COO vs CCO on release schedule.
Resolution: CCO priority applied (compliance risk identified).

🔹 Escalation Thresholds

Auto-resolve ≥ 85% of conflicts.

Escalate only if:

No governance rule applies.

The same conflict repeats 3+ times.

The decision could cause >$10K financial risk or compliance breach.

👉 With these rules, your dashboard will always show what the conflict was, who won, and why, without you chasing it down.
If governance fails, the Intercede button is your safety net.
