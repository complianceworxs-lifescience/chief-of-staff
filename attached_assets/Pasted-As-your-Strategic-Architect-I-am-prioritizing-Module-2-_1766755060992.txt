As your Strategic Architect, I am prioritizing Module 2: The Revenue Engine. This secures our monetization path before we build secondary content.

Copy the grouped prompt below into Replit to deploy the Pricing, Login, and Sign Up infrastructure.

Phase 4: Module 2 Grouped Prompt (Revenue & Access)
@replit Implement the Pricing, Login, and Sign Up infrastructure using the 2025 Pharma Palette.

1. Pricing Page (Revenue-First)
Layout: Three-card horizontal comparison.

Tier 1: Rising Leader ($299/mo) — 5 SOP Assessments/mo, Basic Gap Analysis, PDF Exports.

Tier 2: Validation Strategist ($899/mo) — Best Value. 25 Assessments/mo, Remediation Prompts, Virtual Auditor Simulation.

Tier 3: Compliance Architect (Custom) — Unlimited Assessments, Multi-User Enterprise Access, RSI Self-Correction, 21 CFR Part 11 Audit Logs.

Visuals: Use Sage Green (#2D5A27) for the "Strategist" card to drive conversion. Use Coral (#FF6B6B) for "Architect" CTA.

2. Detailed Feature Comparison
Add a technical table below the cards. Columns: Feature, Rising Leader, Strategist, Architect.

Include rows for: "Audit-Ready Evidence," "ISO 13485 Mapping," "FDA 21 CFR Track," "AI Remediation," and "Team Governance."

3. Authentication Infrastructure (Login/Sign Up)
Sign Up Form: Capture Email, Full Name, Company, and Firm Type (Biotech, Pharma, MedTech, Consultant).

Login Form: Minimalist Navy (#002D62) header with "Forgot Password" functionality.

Success Action: On Sign Up, redirect the user immediately to the L5.5 Command Center Dashboard.

4. Global Navigation Routing
Link the top-level menu items "Pricing," "Login," and "Sign Up" to these new sections.

Ensure the "Sign Up" button in the header remains the most prominent element.

Strategic Reasoning
The "Strategist" Anchor: Pricing is structured to push users toward the $899 tier, where the "Virtual Auditor" logic resides—this is our unique differentiator.

Conversion Momentum: Directing users from Sign Up to the L5.5 Dashboard immediately proves value and reduces churn.
