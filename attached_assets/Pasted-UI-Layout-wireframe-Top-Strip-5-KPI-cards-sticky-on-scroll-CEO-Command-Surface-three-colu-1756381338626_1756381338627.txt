UI Layout (wireframe)

Top Strip (5 KPI cards) — sticky on scroll.

CEO Command Surface — three columns: Decision Inbox • Next Best Actions • Brief Generator.

Initiatives RAG board — cards with health meter, milestones, risks, path‑to‑green.

Communication Bridge — latest meeting synth, drafts, escalation ladder with timers.

Intelligence → Insight → Directive — insight cards; one‑click directive sender.

Alerts & Guardrails — Decision Debt, Runway Actions, Compliance Clock.

Design system: same rounded cards/soft shadows; reduce widget count; emphasize decisions. Mobile: collapse RAG to accordion; keep Top Strip visible.

J) Rendering & Delivery

Inputs: scoreboard.json, initiatives.json, decisions.json, actions.json, meetings.json, optional insights.json.

Validation: schema/shape checks; on error send "DATA GAP" alert with missing fields.

Render: web dashboard + optional daily HTML email snapshot for CEO.

Log: archive a copy of inputs + rendered HTML to cof_reports/{date}/ for lineage.

K) SLAs & Success Criteria

SLA: dashboard fresh by 06:35 local; Decision Inbox never >3 open >24h.

Success metrics:

CEO clears ≥90% daily decisions in ≤10 min.

Initiative Health +10 points over 14 days.

Alignment ≥85%, Autonomy ≥90%, MTTR <5 min.

Revenue Pace Green 4 of 5 days/week.

L) Notes on Integrations (non‑exclusive)

Comms/Meetings: Slack, Gmail, Zoom/Meet transcripts.

Work mgmt: Asana/Jira/Trello for task syncing (optional).

Data: Stripe/MemberPress, MailerLite, Shield (LinkedIn), GA4/WP.

No hard dependency: CoS should function with existing internal agents/logs.

End of Spec — hand this file to Replit as cos_dashboard_spec.md and wire the inputs accordingly.

Done. I’ve dropped a full “CoS Dashboard — Strategic Cockpit Spec (v1)” into the canvas with:
