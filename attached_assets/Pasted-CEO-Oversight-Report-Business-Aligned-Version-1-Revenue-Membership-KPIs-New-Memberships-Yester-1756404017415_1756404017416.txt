CEO Oversight Report (Business-Aligned Version)
1. Revenue & Membership KPIs

New Memberships Yesterday (by tier: Rising Leader / Validation Strategist / Compliance Architect)

Cancellations / Churn %

Net New MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

Upsells (ELSA reports, partner referrals, etc.)

👉 This tells you immediately if money moved in/out of the business yesterday.

2. Funnel Conversion Insights

Top Traffic Sources Yesterday (LinkedIn posts, email campaigns, referrals)

Quiz Completions → Membership Conversions %

Email CTR vs Conversion (from MailerLite campaigns)

👉 This shows whether your funnel is functioning and where it’s leaking.

3. Engagement Metrics

LinkedIn Performance (impressions, engagement rate, CTA clicks)

Content Published vs Readership/Downloads (blog posts, whitepapers, ELSA reports)

Member Engagement (logins, dashboard usage, time on platform)

👉 Helps you see what content/messaging is resonating and driving value.

4. Agent & System Oversight

Critical Agent Success/Failure (CEO, CRO, CMO, CCO)

Alerts Needing CEO Attention (e.g., revenue below target, churn spike, compliance report failure)

Autonomy Score (how much agents resolved without human intervention)

👉 Keeps the automation governance front and center without burying you in raw activity counts.

5. Forward-Looking Recommendations

Instead of “low priority: 2 pieces published,” include an insight statement per day, e.g.:

“LinkedIn posts criticizing GPT drove +19% higher engagement vs benchmarks — consider doubling frequency this week.”

“Validation Strategist tier produced 3x higher LTV yesterday — CRO agent recommends allocating ad spend there.”

“Revenue on track for $X this week; to hit target, +Y memberships needed in next 3 days.”

✅ In short: Replace activity counts with money, members, funnel health, and forward-looking recommendations.
Your report should answer:

Did revenue grow or shrink yesterday?

Did the funnel work?

Are members engaging?

Did any critical system fail?

What should I (the CEO) do or know today?
