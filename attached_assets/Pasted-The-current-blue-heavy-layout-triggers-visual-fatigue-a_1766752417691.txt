The current blue-heavy layout triggers visual fatigue and contradicts the 2025 "human-centric" shift.

Why this follows the "Architect" PersonaData Over Decoration: By switching to an off-white base, the data (like your Risk Score) becomes the focal point rather than the interface background.Standardized Indicators: Using Sage Green and Coral follows emerging 2025 color-coding standards that reduce cognitive load for professionals managing complex QMS data.Inclusive Accessibility: This higher-contrast, less monochromatic scheme meets the strict 2025 accessibility standards required for medical software.
