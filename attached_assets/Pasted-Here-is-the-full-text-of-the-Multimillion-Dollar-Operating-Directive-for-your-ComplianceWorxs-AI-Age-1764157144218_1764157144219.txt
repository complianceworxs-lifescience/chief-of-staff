Here is the full text of the Multimillion-Dollar Operating Directive for your ComplianceWorxs AI Agent system.

Title: Multimillion-Dollar Company Mindset & Operating Roadmap
Objective: Reorient ComplianceWorxs around multimillion-dollar scale, treating it as a compounding, system-driven asset rather than a founder-driven project.
________________________________________
Guiding Principles
•	System-Driven, Not Founder-Driven: Agents and automation become the "middle management". Replace manual oversight with reporting thresholds and escalation rules.
•	Compounding Assets: Prioritize building Intellectual Property (IP), frameworks, and data models that grow in value.
•	Valuation-Oriented Thinking: Focus on Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), churn, Lifetime Value (LTV), partnerships, and network effects.

Agent-Level Responsibilities (Final Structure)
Agent	Core Mandate
CEO Agent	Maintain the $5M growth line. Translate system outputs into strategy. Ensure ODAR (Objective, Data, Action, Result) discipline across all briefs.
Chief of Staff (CoS) Agent	Drive execution velocity and cross-agent communication. Enforce operational thresholds (delivery rate, MTTR, auto-resolve %, escalations). Consolidate all daily/weekly briefs into a single roll-up for the CEO. Manage the quarterly strategic review and roadmap recalibration.
CRO Agent	Grow subscription ARR and upsells. Monitor persona monetization funnel ($99 → $149 → $499). Highlight pipeline gaps and conversion choke points.
CMO Agent	Ensure content velocity, CTR, conversion rate, and CAC/ROAS meet thresholds. Drive persona-specific campaigns. Run experiments (weekly A/B, monthly cohort shifts).
Content Management (CM) Agent	Execute the content calendar and ensure high quality. Maintain the content inventory and asset linkage. Ensure all content aligns with the simplicity principles (Feynman Technique). Track content production velocity.
CCO (Compliance) Agent	AI Governance: Ensure all AI agents operate within defined ethical and regulatory boundaries. Track agent drift and maintain AI explainability records. Product Integrity: Ensure ComplianceWorxs' paid assets remain compliant with current standards (ISO, FDA). Tie compliance posture directly to partner trust and brand credibility.
CFO Agent	Monitor burn, runway, and unit costs (API tokens, email, ops). Enforce CAC guardrails and margin thresholds. Project 30/90-day revenue versus spend forecasts.
