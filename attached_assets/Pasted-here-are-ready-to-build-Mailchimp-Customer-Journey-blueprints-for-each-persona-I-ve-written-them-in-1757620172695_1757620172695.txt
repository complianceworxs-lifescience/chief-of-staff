here are ready-to-build Mailchimp Customer Journey blueprints for each persona. I’ve written them in Mailchimp-native terms (Starting Point, Delays, If/Else, Actions) with node names, conditions, and email prompts so your COO Agent (or you, if ever needed) can paste/translate straight into the Journey builder.
________________________________________
🔧 Shared Setup (Use Once)
Merge fields (Audience settings)
•	PERSONA (text: RL/VS/CA)
•	ROI_VAL (number)
•	TIER_REC (text: RL/VS/CA)
•	SRC (text)
•	TXN_ID (text)
Tags
•	Rising Leader / Validation Strategist / Compliance Architect
•	ROI_Engaged (applied on ROICalculated)
•	MC_Recommended (applied on MembershipRecommended)
•	Member (applied on MembershipPurchased)
Custom Events (via API / GTM collector → Mailchimp Journeys API)
•	QuizCompleted (props: persona)
•	ROICalculated (props: persona, roi_value, calc_version)
•	MembershipRecommended (props: persona, recommended_tier, roi_value)
•	MembershipPurchased (props: persona, tier, amount, txn_id)
Global Suppression & Collision Rules
•	Contacts with tag Member skip all pre-purchase journeys.
•	Each persona journey only accepts contacts with matching PERSONA.
•	Re-entry: allow re-entry every 30 days unless tag Member present.
Link targets (example)
•	Membership Calculator: /membership-calculator?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=roi_to_membership
•	Tier LPs:
o	RL → /membership/rising-leader?utm_source=mc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=offer_rl
o	VS → /membership/validation-strategist?utm_source=mc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=offer_vs
o	CA → /membership/compliance-architect?utm_source=mc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=offer_ca

1) Journey: ROI_RisingLeader_Journey
Starting Point
Event trigger: ROICalculated where persona == RL
Entry actions:
•	Action: Update Merge → PERSONA = RL, ROI_VAL = {{roi_value}}
•	Action: Add Tag → ROI_Engaged
Node A — Email #1: “Make Your Impact Visible”
•	Send Email
o	Subject: Your compliance ROI: turn numbers into recognition
o	Body angle: “You’ve got the ROI. Here’s how to use it for visibility and promotion.”
o	Primary CTA: Membership Calculator
•	Delay: 2 days
Node B — If Clicked MC?
•	Rule: If user clicked Membership Calculator link in Email #1
o	Yes → Node C
o	No → Node B2
Node B2 — Nudge Email (if No Click)
•	Send Email #1a: Still thinking? Convert your ROI into a concrete plan.
•	CTA: Membership Calculator
•	Delay: 2 days → then to Node C
Node C — Wait for MembershipRecommended
•	Goal Wait: Up to 5 days for event MembershipRecommended (persona=RL)
o	On Goal hit → Node D
o	On timeout → Node C2 (fallback)
Node C2 — Fallback
•	Send Email #2: What’s the fastest way to capture your ROI?
•	CTA: Membership Calculator
•	Delay: 2 days → back to Goal wait (2 more days)
Node D — Offer Path (Tier RL)
•	Action: Update Merge → TIER_REC = RL
•	Send Email #3 (Offer)
o	Subject: Rising Leader Plan: unlock visibility + momentum
o	Body: bullet benefits; “recognition-first” framing
o	CTA: Tier RL LP
•	Delay: 3 days
Node E — If Purchased?
•	Rule: If MembershipPurchased (tier=RL) occurs within 7 days
o	Yes → Exit & Handoff to Post-Purchase Journeys
o	No → Email #3a (Objection Handler)
	Subject: Questions about the plan? Here’s how members use it
	Content: quick FAQ + 2 social proofs
	CTA: Tier RL LP
	Delay: 4 days → End Journey
Exit: End or move to re-engagement (optional 30-day revisit).

2) Journey: ROI_ValidationStrategist_Journey
Starting Point
Event: ROICalculated where persona == VS
Entry actions: Update merge fields; add ROI_Engaged tag.
Node A — Email #1: “Cut Validation Time, Not Corners”
•	Subject: Your ROI shows time on the table — here’s how to reclaim it
•	Angle: time savings in validation; fewer deviations; cycle compression
•	CTA: Membership Calculator
•	Delay: 2 days
Node B — Click Split
•	If MC clicked → Node C
•	Else → Email #1a (case example: “How Strategists compress validation by 30–50%”) → Delay 2 days → Node C
Node C — Goal Wait: MembershipRecommended (VS)
•	Wait up to 5 days; fallback Email #2 (“See the plan that captures your ROI”) → Delay 2 days → re-wait 2 days.
Node D — Offer (Tier VS)
•	Update TIER_REC = VS
•	Email #3 Offer: Validation Strategist Plan: faster cycles, fewer headaches
•	CTA: Tier VS LP
•	Delay: 3 days
Node E — Purchase Split
•	If MembershipPurchased (tier=VS) within 7 days → Exit to Post-Purchase
•	Else → Email #3a (Proof pack: KPI gains + testimonial snippet) → Delay 4 days → End.

3) Journey: ROI_ComplianceArchitect_Journey
Starting Point
Event: ROICalculated where persona == CA
Entry actions: Update merge; tag ROI_Engaged.
Node A — Email #1: “Turn Compliance ROI into Board-Level Clarity”
•	Subject: Your projected ROI → the enterprise case
•	Angle: audit readiness KPIs, risk reduction, enterprise ROI
•	CTA: Membership Calculator
•	Delay: 2 days
Node B — If MC Clicked?
•	Yes → Node C
•	No → Email #1a: From ROI to strategy: the architecture of value (executive framing) → Delay 2 days → Node C
Node C — Goal Wait: MembershipRecommended (CA)
•	Wait up to 5 days; fallback Email #2 (Model the board case in 10 minutes) → Delay 2 days → re-wait 2 days.
Node D — Offer (Tier CA)
•	Update TIER_REC = CA
•	Email #3 Offer: Compliance Architect Plan: enterprise KPIs + audit-ready dashboards
•	CTA: Tier CA LP
•	Delay: 3 days
Node E — If Purchased?
•	Yes (tier=CA) within 7 days → Exit to Post-Purchase
•	No → Email #3a (Executive objection handler: budget, timing, risk) → Delay 4 days → End.
________________________________________
4) Post-Purchase Journeys (All Tiers)
Starting Point: MembershipPurchased (any tier; Member tag applied)
Tier-Specific Welcome (within 1 hour)
•	RL: Welcome_RisingLeader — “Your first 3 wins this week”
•	VS: Welcome_ValidationStrategist — “Ship your first cycle-time win”
•	CA: Welcome_ComplianceArchitect — “Instrument your KPIs + audit traceability”
Day 2 — Activation Email
•	Checklist: how to access dashboards, connect to the widget, where to find ELSA docs.
•	CTA: book a 10-min orientation (optional).
Day 5 — AI Agent Upsell (all tiers)
•	Email: “Automate the next win with AI Agents”
•	Segment logic:
o	RL → CMO/COO lite use cases (personal productivity, recognition)
o	VS → CCO/COO use cases (validation cycle compression)
o	CA → CEO/CRO use cases (KPI governance, audit readiness)
•	CTA: Agent Upsell page.
Suppressions
•	Suppress all pre-purchase journeys once Member tag exists.
•	Deduplicate if TXN_ID repeats.
________________________________________
5) Dynamic Content & Personalization Rules
In all journey emails, show conditional blocks by thresholds:
•	If ROI_VAL >= 100000: show “Executive case” block (CA emphasis).
•	If ROI_VAL 30000–99999: show “Operational efficiency” block (VS emphasis).
•	If ROI_VAL < 30000: show “Career recognition + quick wins” block (RL emphasis).
Personalize headlines with merge fields:
•	Your ROI: $*|ROI_VAL|* — here’s how to capture it
•	Include persona-specific bullets using IF PERSONA == RL/VS/CA.
________________________________________
6) Goals, Exit Conditions & SLAs (apply to all)
•	Primary Goal: MembershipPurchased reached → Exit Journey (handoff to Post-Purchase).
•	Secondary Goal: If no purchase within 14 days of start → exit, apply tag Reengage_30d, and enroll in a light re-engagement journey later.
•	SLA: First email within 120 seconds of event trigger. Monitor via automation logs.
________________________________________
7) Error Handling & Rollback
•	If events stop appearing for 30+ minutes:
1.	Pause affected Journey(s).
2.	Switch GTM to prior container version.
3.	Re-run E2E tests for each persona with test contacts.
4.	Re-enable with 10% canary for 2 hours; then full release.

8) Copy Starters (you can paste into Mailchimp)
Email #1 (RL)
•	Subject: Your compliance ROI: turn numbers into recognition
•	Preheader: Next step: make your wins visible
•	CTA: “Calculate your best-fit plan”
Email #1 (VS)
•	Subject: Your ROI shows time on the table

10) What your COO Agent does next (no ambiguity)
1.	Create/verify merge fields and tags.
2.	Create custom events (or confirm your collector sends them).
3.	Build the three persona journeys exactly as above.
4.	Build Post-Purchase journey.
5.	Paste the email copy starters and set dynamic blocks by PERSONA and ROI_VAL.
6.	Set goals, exit, re-entry, and suppression rules.
7.	Run QA Matrix (3 test contacts → 3 persona paths).
8.	Flip to live with canary (10% audience for 2 hours), then 100%.
9.	Report status in the Automations Status Report with pass/fail on each node.
