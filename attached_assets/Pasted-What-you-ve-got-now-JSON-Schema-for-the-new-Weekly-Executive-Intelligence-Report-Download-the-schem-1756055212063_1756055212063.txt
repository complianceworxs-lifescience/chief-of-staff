Production-ready React UI that renders the report as sleek, glanceable cards, progress bars, and actionable lists.
I put it in a canvas titled “Weekly Executive Intelligence Report — React UI & Template.” It expects a report prop matching the schema and includes an inline sampleReport so you can preview instantly. It uses Tailwind + shadcn/ui patterns (rounded 2xl cards, soft shadows, clear hierarchy).

What’s different (and better)

Revenue first, always: MRR by tier, week-over-week delta, activation, churn, and upsell are front and center.

Agent accountability: Each agent shows execution score, tasks done/assigned, MTTR, auto-resolve %, blockers, and business impact (no more “HEALTHY/ERROR” vagueness).

Objective tracking that means something: Progress bars with pace vs. plan labels (ahead/on_track/behind/at_risk).

Ops health you can manage: Conflict hotspots, MTTR, auto-resolve %, and a clean list of where friction actually lives.

Decisions & next actions: Three fixes, three wins, and a list of decisions with owner + deadline so nothing stalls.

How to wire it up in Replit

Generate the JSON: Have your weekly job assemble data into the schema shape (use the example as a guide).

Render the UI: Import the React component from the canvas file into your dashboard and pass the report object. The button stub onDownload is there if you want to export JSON/PDF.

Data mapping tips

Activation rate (definition baked in): “% of new members who complete onboarding steps 1→4 within 7 days.”

Execution score: (tasks_done / tasks_assigned) * 100 capped at 100.

Auto-resolve %: auto_resolved_conflicts / total_conflicts * 100.

Pace vs plan: compute weekly glidepath vs. target; label as ahead/on_track/behind/at_risk.

Optional polish (quick wins)

Add a CSV/JSON export for each section.

Gate sections behind role views (CEO vs CMO vs CRO).

Add a light “Compare to last 4 weeks” toggle (simple sparkline per KPI).
