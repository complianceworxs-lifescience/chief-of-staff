Weekly Intelligence Report” useless — it gives you vague grades (F, 59%), generic “errors,” and a conflict count that doesn’t actually help you run or grow ComplianceWorxs
. What you really need is an executive-level intelligence brief that tells you whether your agents are moving the business toward revenue and strategic clarity.

Here’s what I recommend restructuring the report to show:

1. Revenue & Growth Metrics (Top Priority)

MRR (by Tier): Current, last week, delta (%).

Revenue Drivers: Which campaigns, partners, or offers contributed most.

Activation Rate: % of new members who completed onboarding (critical for retention).

Churn & Retention: How many members dropped, why, and the projected impact.

Upsell Performance: % of Rising Leaders upgrading to Strategist/Architect.

2. Agent Performance (Actionable, Not Binary)

Instead of “HEALTHY/ERROR,” show:

Execution Score: Did the agent complete its assigned directives? (e.g., CMO executed 6/8 campaigns, 75%).

Blockers: What specifically caused “ERROR” (API auth failure, missing data, directive conflict).

Impact: What strategic goal did the failure stall? (e.g., CRO Agent downtime = delayed $10k in projected revenue).

3. Strategic Objective Tracking

Each OKR should have a clear status bar, not just “contributing agents”:

Increase Monthly Revenue by $50K → $14.2K progress (+28%), behind target.

Improve Retention by 15% → Retention flat at 73%, no improvement.

Expand Content Reach by 40% → LinkedIn impressions +12%, blog reads +7%.

Increase Tier 3 MRR by 20% → +5% this week, ahead of pace.

4. Operational Health

Conflict Hotspots: Which agents keep generating conflicts and what the root cause is.

MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution): Average time to resolve conflicts (e.g., <5 minutes = healthy).

Autonomy Check: % of conflicts auto-resolved vs. requiring human review.

5. Opportunities & Risks

Emerging Opportunities: e.g., “Architect signups trending up 12% after LinkedIn webinar.”

Revenue Risks: e.g., “If COO onboarding bug isn’t fixed, 30% of new Rising Leaders may churn in week 2.”

Cost Risks: API usage or compute spikes (to keep Replit spend under control).

6. Next Actions (CEO-level view)

Top 3 Fixes: (Example)

CRO Agent auth error → preventing revenue attribution, fix within 24h.

CMO Agent stalled email sequence → delaying nurture path for 42 new leads.

COO onboarding drop-off at step 3 → costing ~15% conversion.

Top 3 Wins: (Example)

100% of conflicts resolved without escalation.

Market Intelligence Agent flagged 2 new consulting partner opportunities.

LinkedIn content share rate doubled vs. last week.

👉 In short, instead of grades + errors, you need progress toward revenue, retention, and expansion, with agent accountability tied to business outcomes.
