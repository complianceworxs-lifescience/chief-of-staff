There is no ambiguity.
The transition is triggered only when ALL five readiness categories meet the thresholds below—because L6 is not “more autonomy”; it is meta-autonomy (agents redesigning the business model itself).

This framework is engineered for ComplianceWorxs’ risk profile: regulatory, reputation-sensitive, and audit-grade.

L6 TRANSITION READINESS FRAMEWORK (Critical Thresholds)
1. REVENUE STABILITY METRIC
**Threshold to Unlock L6:

Weekly Revenue Sprints must hit ≥ 85% target for 6 consecutive weeks.**

Why:
An unstable revenue system cannot support strategic redesign.
L6 introduces controlled experimentation that can temporarily reduce performance; the baseline must be strong enough to absorb volatility.

2. PREDICTION ACCURACY METRIC (RPM Stability)
**Threshold to Unlock L6:

RPM revenue predictability must achieve ≥ 92% accuracy for 30 consecutive days.**

Why:
If predictions are unstable, any L6-level redesign (pricing, offer ladder modifications, new markets) will destabilize the core engine.

92% is the level at which:

model variance is low

risk-adjusted forecast is trustworthy

predictive inputs (signals, objections, friction) are normalized

3. OBJECTION STABILITY METRIC
**Threshold to Unlock L6:

Objection clusters must show no new categories for 30 days.**

Why:
L6 experimentation is impossible if the system is still discovering baseline objections.
You need stable, known friction before changing your product or narrative.

Indicators of readiness:

No emergent objections in IT, QA, Finance

Declining skepticism signals

Stakeholder Packets show stable utilization patterns

4. BLUEPRINT PERFORMANCE METRIC (Demand-Side Maturity)
**Threshold to Unlock L6:

CMO’s Archetype performance variance must narrow to within ±15%.**

Meaning:
The Dark Social Blueprint is now:

predictable

trust-efficient

modular

ready to support new markets or narratives

L6 requires the demand engine to be stable at scale.

5. SYSTEM COHERENCE METRIC (Agent Harmony Index)
**Threshold to Unlock L6:

CoS reports zero cross-agent contradictions or drift incidents over two full ODAR cycles (48 hours).**

Contradictions =

Strategist simulation misaligned with CMO demand patterns

CRO offer ladder deviations

Packet friction not corrected

UDL update failures

WIS anomalies

VQS boundary tension

L6 redesign requires the system to behave as a single agent, not four independent units.

THE FIVE MUST ALL BE TRUE. NOT SOME. ALL.

If even one of these fails, the system is not ready.

ADDITIONAL SAFETY SIGNALS (Optional But Strong Predictors)
A. Trust Momentum Positive for 30 Days

Saves

Silent lurker re-engagement

Comment quality

Profile views after Archetype E posts

B. Conversion Velocity Trend Up + Stable

No sudden drops in:
Tier 1 → Tier 2 movement
Tier 2 → Tier 3 uplift
Micro-offer performance
CTA response rates

C. No VQS Tension Detected for 30 Days

Final authority: Strategist.

SUMMARY: WHEN TO TRANSITION

You transition to L6 only when the system is predictable.
Not before.

L6 = Strategic redesign.
Redesign requires stability.

The earliest possible transition occurs when:

Revenue predictability is high

Objections stop evolving

Demand signals normalize

Conversion behavior becomes consistent

All agents operate in lockstep without drift

At that moment, L6 becomes an asset instead of a liability.
