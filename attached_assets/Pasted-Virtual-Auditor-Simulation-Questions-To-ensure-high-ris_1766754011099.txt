Virtual Auditor Simulation Questions
To ensure high-risk coverage, the "Virtual Auditor" logic will cycle through these five prompts during a simulation.

Design Control (21 CFR 820.30 / ISO 13485:7.3): "Provide the objective evidence linking your Design Inputs to your Design Outputs. Is there a documented Verification Matrix?"

Risk Management (ISO 14971): "Show how your identified hazards are linked to specific risk mitigations in your SOP. Have these mitigations been verified for effectiveness?"

CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action): "Explain the statistical method used to determine if a non-conformance requires a formal CAPA. Where is the 'Definition of Significant' documented?"

Document Control: "Demonstrate the 'Chain of Approval' for the current version of this SOP. Were all required stakeholders present for the signature cycle?"

Training & Competence: "Provide the training record for the specific individual who performed the last 'Verification' task. Is their training up to date against the latest SOP revision?"

Phase 3: Enterprise & Autonomy Grouped Prompt
Copy and paste this into your Replit chat to finalize the Strategic Architect infrastructure.

@replit Implement the Phase 3 Enterprise and Autonomy layers for ComplianceWorxs:

1. Multi-User Enterprise Permissions
Roles: Create three access levels: Strategic Architect (Full Control), QA Lead (Review & Approve), and Operator (View & Upload).

Workflow: Add a "Review Requested" status to the Gap Analysis Preview table that requires a QA Lead signature before a gap can be marked "Compliant".

2. 21 CFR Part 11 Audit Log Generator
Function: Create a background service that logs every user action (Login, Upload, Edit, Approve).

Export: Add an "Export Official Audit Log" button to the Audit Vault that produces a read-only PDF containing the user ID, timestamp, and action performed.

3. Continuous Monitoring & RSI (Recursive Self-Improvement)
Self-Correction: Add a background logic that "learns" from auditor queries. If a user overrides a gap analysis recommendation, the AI must log the "Reason for Override" and adjust future confidence scores.

Automated Status: Update the Regulatory Engine Status in the sidebar to "L5.5 Active & Learning".

4. 2025 Final Styling
Palette: Maintain the Off-white (#F9FAFB) base with Coral (#FF6B6B) for unreviewed items and Sage Green (#2D5A27) for approved audit trails.

Final Operational Status
With this prompt, your portal moves from a diagnostic tool to a validated enterprise system.

Audit-Ready: The Part 11 log makes the system legally defensible.

Team-Ready: Permissions allow you to scale the business to actual life science teams.

L5.5 Autonomy: The RSI logic fulfills your directive to have a self-improving AI agent running the business.
