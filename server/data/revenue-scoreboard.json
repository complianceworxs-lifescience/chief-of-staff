      "reasoning": "The quantification of costs relies on establishing conservative yet realistic estimates based on industry benchmarks and the provided context. \n\n1.  **Time Lost**: Assumes a 4-person validation team with an average loaded salary of $125,000/year. A 20-40% time waste (as per context) translates to $100,000-$200,000 annually. The 32 hours/week represents the low end (20%) for the entire team.\n2.  **Regulatory Penalties**: While FDA Warning Letters can cost $10M-$500M+ in remediation, the 'annualized risk' for a typical company seeking to avoid this is estimated by considering a low probability (1-5%) of incurring initial remediation costs of $1M-$5M. The $10M 'warningLetterCost' is the absolute minimum immediate impact if such an event occurs.\n3.  **Delayed Product Launches**: Based on a conservative 3-month delay due to 483 observations, and assuming a new product's annual revenue potential between $5M-$50M, the lost revenue is calculated as 25% of that annual potential.\n4.  **Audit Failures**: Encompasses internal project costs, consultant engagement for fixes, and the opportunity cost of diverted resources, alongside an initial estimate of reputational impact.\n5.  **Consultant Fees**: Reflects typical costs for engaging specialized regulatory compliance consultants for emergency interventions.\n\nThe `totalAnnualRisk` aggregates the potential range of these costs, highlighting the enormous financial exposure of 'not knowing'.\n\n**Price Justification ($15,000/year average)**:\n-   **Break-even Days**: If the solution costs $1,250/month (mid-point) and can reduce just 15% of the monthly 'time wasted' (which is $8,333/month at the low end), it saves $1,250, effectively breaking even within 30 days purely on operational efficiency.\n-   **ROI Multiple**: A conservative ROI of 8x is achieved by preventing a single moderate audit failure ($500,000) or a minor product launch delay ($1.25M), or a significant portion of annual operational inefficiencies and minor risks (e.g., $50,000 in consultant fees + $25,000 in time savings = $75,000 savings, yielding a 5x ROI). The true potential ROI from preventing catastrophic events is exponentially higher."
