      "reasoning": "The VP Quality (or Head of Quality) stands out as the PRIMARY buyer because this role holds the highest level of strategic accountability for an organization's overall quality and compliance posture. They are directly responsible for ensuring regulatory adherence, mitigating risk, and managing the entire quality management system. Crucially, they are tasked with justifying departmental budgets and demonstrating the value of quality and compliance initiatives to the executive board. The drive for 'professional equity' directly aligns with their need to prove that 'Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset.' They possess the necessary decision-making authority, control significant budgets, and acutely feel the pain points of manual processes and audit failures. While other roles like Compliance Director or Quality Director are highly influential and key users, the VP Quality typically has the ultimate sign-off on major enterprise-level software purchases and is responsible for framing compliance as a strategic enabler rather than just a cost."

Beyond the direct and catastrophic costs of warning letters and product delays, companies suffer from substantial, continuous drains on resources due to manual processes and the hidden expenses of audit failures. Our analysis quantifies these risks, demonstrating that a Tier II (Velocity) solution, priced at ~$500-2000/month, can break even by saving just 22 days of manual validation work annually for a single engineer, while delivering an ROI of 7x or more on time savings alone. This does not even account for the immense value in averting multi-million dollar penalties and preserving market opportunities. Compliance is no longer overhead. Compliance is a measurable business asset."
