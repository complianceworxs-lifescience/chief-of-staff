Regulatory and launch impact figures are derived from the given context, scaled to annualized risk or representative single-event costs for a company that would find a $500-2000/month tool appealing. The ROI and break-even calculations demonstrate that even modest improvements in efficiency or risk mitigation quickly justify the SaaS investment, effectively turning a cost center into a value driver. The 'True Cost of Not Knowing' extends far beyond direct fines, encompassing operational inefficiencies, lost market opportunities, and reputational damage."
