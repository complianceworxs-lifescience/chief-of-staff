Critically, their career advancement ('professional equity') is tied to their ability to demonstrate that compliance is not just a cost center but a measurable business asset that drives value. This requires significant budget control, the need to justify investments with clear ROI, and the ability to articulate compliance benefits to executive leadership. They acutely feel the pain of inefficient processes and the pressure of audits, making them highly motivated to invest in solutions that offer efficiency, data integrity, and strategic insights."

The identified weaknesses and switch triggers directly address these complexities. Software competitors are also analyzed, but their weaknesses are framed in terms of *their own* potential complexity or limitations, aligning with the core research question's focus on complexity.
