They have the budget influence, decision-making authority (or lead the decision-making process), and feel the pain points of manual compliance acutely, making them the most motivated to champion and purchase solutions that offer strategic defense and measurable value.

A Tier II (Velocity) solution, priced at ~$500-2000/month (averaging $15,000/year), offers immediate and substantial ROI. By automating compliance tasks, it can reduce manual labor costs by approximately $75,000 annually (assuming a 50% reduction in typical time wasted), achieving a break-even point in approximately 73 days and yielding a 5x ROI from direct time savings alone. More critically, it significantly reduces the probability and severity of multi-million dollar product launch delays, warning letter remediation, and audit failures – adding an estimated $50,000+ annually in risk mitigation. This combined value drives the ROI to over 8x, demonstrating that compliance is no longer overhead but a measurable business asset that safeguards and grows enterprise value."
