They possess the decision-making authority for significant software investments, the budget control, and critically, the need to prove ROI to senior leadership. Their pain points stem from the systemic failures of manual processes that translate into audit risks and operational inefficiencies, which they are responsible for resolving. They are motivated by achieving audit readiness, mitigating risk, and enhancing the strategic value of the quality function within the enterprise, thereby gaining 'executive visibility' and 'strategic defense' for their department and their career."
